In our ports in the [trade_province.GetName] province, and especially [trade_province.GetCapitalName] itself these merchants have become so commonplace that they are now an integral part of the urban population.\nRecently some of these traders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], asking to be allowed to build a settlement of their own, just outside [trade_province.GetCapitalName] proper."

 foi_propagate_religion_events.2.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries have settled down in [trade_province.GetName] to found a new community there for themselves and their converts.

The Church is the new clear center of the community and will likely attract greater numbers to settle here. It will also facilitate local conversion of the entire area.\nThere is clear indication that the new Church is in part being funded by the many [converter_country.GetAdjective] traders active in the region, and in our government some worry that this might lead to undue influence for them and their religion."

Many have in fact started to demand affrimation of the [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s right to rule by the grace of God, even though our official state religion is still [Root.Religion.GetName]. Some advisors of [Root.Monarch.GetName] now suggest that it might be prudent to go along with this. If we start referring to our own country as ruled by the grace of God, it might easen relations with the many Christian countries around the world."
