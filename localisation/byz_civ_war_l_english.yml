 foi_flavor_byz_civ.1.desc.a:0 "Though the death of our great Basileus Ioannes has brought us much pain, there is no time for despair. His son Konstantinos Andronikos is ready to follow in his father's path, as Konstantinos XI. He is generally loved by the people and the aristocracy alike - a rare occurrence in a country that has seen so many civil wars. There is only one small thing... His health is - rather unpredictable. Should he - god forbid it - pass on before his time, the country could face serious internal strife, as his succession is rather disputed, but let's not spoil this time of both grief and joy with dark thoughts of an of yet uncertain future."
 foi_flavor_byz_civ.1.desc.b:0 "The death of our great Basileus Ioannes without an heir has brought great danger to our country. As his son Konstantinos Andronikos already passed on, the peculiar dynastic situation leaves no less than seventeen claimants to the throne, and even though only three of them have realistic chances of pushing their claim, we fear that chaos will reign supreme. The family of our late Basileus, the House of Komnenos, has as of now the upper hand, as they are the closest to the court, and will most likely succeed in pressing the claim of their candidate, but the other great houses, the Angeloi, and the Palaiologoi will not let this go unanswered."

While he always was rather sickly, this is something that certainly will kill him sooner or later. What shall we do? Trust in the doctors to cure him, although they seem clueless to what has befallen him?
