He loved them so much that he couldn't resign himself to choose an official heir between them; even on his deathbed, where the five sons supplicated him to choose a successor. Instead, he implored his sons not to fight each other after he passed away but rather designate the next Shah between themselves. They honourned their father's request and finally came to an agreement and chose the youngest brother. From then on, every successor has continued this tradition and each one of the brothers left behind a distinct lineage. When the time comes to choose an official heir to the empire, the five branches of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family assemble and a general vote is done to determine which lineage should provide the next official heir. To provide security in this system from unrestricted ambitions and from power-hungry members, the second [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shah created a special force whose loyalty is only to the actual ruler and act to maintain the status quo between the lineages.

This assures a relatively loyal and efficient base on which the shah can rely on. But lately, one member in particular has distinguished himself as one of our satraps. Because of his outstanding rule over the satrapy, there have been wispers among his followers wondering why he was not made our official heir. They might be whispers for now, but it would be foolish to stand in the way of such a talent."

At each monastic school reside a number of religious scholars, experts within fields such as church history, exegesis of the Holy Scripture, reading, grammar, poetry, music, calligraphy and painting. The monasteries compete to attract the most learned masters and maintain them with great honor and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support.
