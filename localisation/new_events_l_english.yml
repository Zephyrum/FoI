 #Great Schism Decision Events
 foi.eventname1:0 "The Great Schism Mended"
 foi.eventdesc1:0 "At last the Great Schism between the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church has been mended. With the spread of our orthodoxy and the reunification of the Pentarchy, including the vital episcopal see of Rome, the other heretic faiths now hold little sway over the people. There will be those that still cling to these old ways, but they will be few, and the Pentarchy can once more claim universal rule over all of Christendom."

 foi.eventname2:0 "The Great Schism Mended"
 foi.eventdesc2:0 "Ever since the Great Schism in the 11th century, Christendom has been broken into two major parts: the Orthodox east and the Catholic west. But now, with the recent reunification of the Pentarchy and the mending of the two sides, we must make an important decision: either agree to join in Christendom's newfound unity or retain our old ways. What shall we do?"

But now, we have heard that Christendom has united, bringing with it many changes to how their churches are structured. Our subjects want us to implement these new changes in our country. What shall we do?"

 #Tamilakam Events - Propably obsolete, but oh well...
 foi.eventname5:0 "Rise of a Usurper!"
 foi.eventdesc5:0 "Over the centuries the Hindu population has grown further in its hostility toward the Kingdom of Tamilakam. This aggression against our realm has been founded upon the zealous policies pushed by our dynasty the Pandyas. Though the administration has never been viewed kindly by the Hindus, this tension has grown since the enforcement of the Paulose codes and the invitation of the Order of Saint Shimun. As a result of these policies, there has resulted in growing support for a usurper to the throne. Supported by the priestly Brahmin and the Hindu nobility Prince Philipose Chera has amassed a large force and has demanded the throne of the Tamilakam. If we contest the claims of Prince Philipose's it will result in a rebellion and may further weaken our realm to outside threats but if we accept this foolish claim it will allow the Brahmin and Hindu nobility to regain there influence over the administration of the realm."

 foi.event5opt2:0 "We will never listen to these heretics!"
 foi.eventname15:0 "King Philipose"
 foi.eventdesc15:0 "The Pandyan dynasty has been defeated in battle and has been forced to accept the will of the new King of Tamilakam. This triumph over the old order has allowed King Philipose to impose new laws that will elevate tension between the Hindu population and the administration. However, these laws have weakened the authority of Christian institutions and as a result, weakened our ability to collect taxes."

What has begun as a situational and interested political bond have evolved in a close economic, political and military synergy. With our ruler still unmarried and the ruler of Lithuania also unmarried, the fraternal spirit of our peoples to each other is acclaimed all over Europe, our nobility shall over time fuse into one, and with no objections to it, then perhaps in time lead to erasing our lasts boundaries to maybe form in a near future a greater entity to rule us all."

 #Persian Government Heir Events
 foi.eventname9:0 "The Sons of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 foi.eventdesc9:0 "The founder of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty was a caring father who equally loved his five sons. He loved them so much that he couldn't resign himself to choose an official heir between them; even on his deathbed, where the five sons supplicated him to choose a successor. Instead, he implored his sons not to fight each other after he passed away but rather designate the next Shah between themselves. They honoured their father's request and finally came to an agreement and chose the youngest brother. From then on, every successor has continued this tradition and each one of the brothers left behind a distinct lineage. When the time comes to choose an official heir to the empire, the five branches of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family assemble and a general vote is done to determine which lineage should provide the next official heir. To provide security in this system from unrestricted ambitions and from power-hungry members, the second [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shah created a special force whose loyalty is only to the actual ruler and act to maintain the status quo between the lineages. But now, the time as come: the five lineages have assemble and after long deliberation, the official successor of the Shah is from..."

Everyone in the family is educated in the matters of the state and are assigned where they can shine the most: whether it be in the navy, the army, in administration, in the diplomatic corps or even as a satrap. This assures a relatively loyal and efficient base on which the shah can rely on. But lately, one member in particular has distinguished himself as one of our satraps. Because of his outstanding rule over the satrapy, there have been whispers among his followers wondering why he was not made our official heir. They might be whispers for now, but it would be foolish to stand in the way of such a talent."

 foi.eventname11:0 "Assassination!"
 foi.eventdesc11:0 "Even if the official successor of the shah was elected by a majority vote by the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family, it doesn't mean that every transition was peaceful. Jealousy, ambition and grief is also haunting us, and today our heir just payed the price. We have suspicions but no proof for now... What should be our next move?"

That is, until one priest muttered something about the \"Nestorian Heathens\" under his breath.\nA rude joke here, a snide remark there, a few insults, and before anyone could wrap their heads around the events that were unfolding in front of them, the Shah ordered the clergymen to leave the room \"or else\".\n\"This Empire was built on tolerance, and I'll not let some priest who's too big for his pants ruin that!\" the Shah was heard saying as he left the meeting hall.

Founded in the early 5th century, these early communities under the Sassanian Empire were persecuted by the Zoroastrian clergy. However, the power of the Zoroastrian clergy would greatly diminish with the Collapse of the Sassanid Empire in the mid-7th century. Ever since the decline of the Sassanids, the Zoroastrian clergy has attempted to maintain their authority within the lands of Central Persia. With the emergence of the Afsharid dynasty, the Zoroastrian clergy has been able to regain their control over the region, and now the empire has returned to the persecution of the Christian community. With the re-emergence of Christian persecution, refugees from the Persian empire now flock to the cities and courts of the Nestorian world. Inviting these refugees to our nation may provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of culture and science."

The realm is plagued by violent struggles between power-hungry factions since the exile of the prodigal son of Elqosh to the Blue horde territory. This climate of instability has finally reached its breaking point with the return of Rafaal Giray, a supposed Crimean descendant of Jochi who was exiled by Khagan Elqosh himself until now and claimed to be a worthier heir for the Golden Throne.

In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support.

However, all that changed with the Afsharid Dynasty's rise to power and their sworn allegiance to the faith of old. For decades, it has been the job of the Shah to perform a balancing act between the ultra-zealous Zoroastrian clergy's desires and the well-being of the Nestorians in the West. Now, it seems, the tower of blocks that the monarchy has for centuries been trying to keep standing may fall down, and with it, Persian society. The clergy, upset with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s tolerance and wanting retribution against the Christians, have called upon all faithful Zoroastrians to purge the Nestorian menace.

However, with the defeat of the Zoroastrian faith during the previous civil war, many devout Zoroastrians have been forced to flee their homes. Many of these migrants have sought refugee in the Port city of Sanjan which, has been a refugee for Zoroastrian refugees since the late seventh century.

What sets it all apart is whether such deities have enough prominence in their lives to dictate why, when and how they pray. The four spirits they have adopted as their patron deities are also part of our mythology.

We've since established a set of rites through reform, thus becoming the religion we hold dear. However, some claim that our rites are either too strict compared to the "good old times" or that there should be no rites at all, for a man's worth should not be measured in how he prays, but in the fact that he prays to begin with."

However, they have now begun to adopt the local Turkic customs and traditions of their Turkish neighbours. This embracing of Turkic culture within these local Cappadocian populations has led to the province assimilating into the larger Turkish culture. With the Turkish community growing to become the dominant community within the former lands of Cappadocians, this has led to the further strengthening of the crown's control over Anatolia."
