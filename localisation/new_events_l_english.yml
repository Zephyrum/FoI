With the spread of our orthodoxy and the reunification of the Pentarchy, including the vital episcopal see of Rome, the other heretic faiths now hold little sway over the people.

As a  result of these policies, there has resulted in growing support for a usurper to the throne. Supported by the priestly Brahmin and the Hindu nobility Prince Philipose Chera has amassed a large force and has demanded the throne of the Tamilakam. If we contest the claims of Prince Philipose's it will result in a rebellion and may further weaken our realm to outside threats but if we accept this foolish claim it will allow the Brahmin and Hindu nobility to regain there influence over the administration of the realm."

He loved them so much that he couldn't resign himself to choose an official heir between them; even on his deathbed, where the five sons supplicated him to choose a successor. Instead, he implored his sons not to fight each other after he passed away but rather designate the next Shah between themselves. They honored their father's request and finally came to an agreement and chose the youngest brother. From then on, every successor has continued this tradition and each one of the brothers left behind a distinct lineage. When the time comes to choose an official heir to the empire, the five branches of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family assemble and a general vote is done to determine which lineage should provide the next official heir. To provide security in this system from unrestricted ambitions and from power-hungry members, the second [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shah created a special force whose loyalty is only to the actual ruler and act to maintain the status quo between the lineages.

This assures a relatively loyal and efficient base on which the shah can rely on. But lately, one member in particular has distinguished himself as one of our satraps. Because of his outstanding rule over the satrapy, there have been whispers among his followers wondering why he was not made our official heir. They might be whispers for now, but it would be foolish to stand in the way of such a talent."

In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles.
