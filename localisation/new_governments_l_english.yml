 #Byzantine Group
 byzantine_empire_in_decline:0 "Failing Imperial Bureaucracy"
 byzantine_empire_in_decline_desc:0 "The long reign of the Komnenoi Emperors has brought internal turmoil within the Byzantine Empire. Due to corruption and weak and incompetent leadership, the empire has been brought to its knees. Even the reforms and a rather peaceful reign of Ioannes VIII couldn't change the rotten core of the empire. It is time for a cleansing."

 byzantine_government:0 "Roman Imperial Bureaucracy"
 byzantine_government_desc:0 "Established under the leadership of Imperator Caesar Augustus, the imperial bureaucracy has since then evolved to adapt to the changing political environment of the Mediterranean world, with Emperor Justinian implementing the greatest set of reforms in the 6th century, giving the Roman empire it's current framework. However, over the centuries incompetent and corrupt rule under the Komnenoi dynasty, the far too rigid system was corrupted and twisted, until it finally broke. The inflexible system left it to powerful regional lords, to sort out the empire's problems, which led to some families amassing power equal to the emperor. This almost tore the empire apart during the catastrophic war of the Three Eagles. However, we have learned from these mistakes and have restored the Imperial bureaucracy as it was under Justinian, so that it may continue to guide the Roman Empire for centuries to come, but we also included provisions, so the system can adapt more freely to sudden changes."

 roman_senate_government_desc:0 "One of the oldest institutions within the Roman Empire, the Senate, was once the administrative heart of the old Imperial State. Despite this crucial role, the once mighty Imperial Senate has become a mere pawn of the Monarchy. The reemergence of a vibrant merchant and academic class resulted in a desire to restore the Senate's strength to its former glory. Once again a cornerstone of the Roman Empire, the Senate has regained the legislative power to administrate the empire."

 trinakrian_republic_desc:0 "After the line of the Norman kings of Sicily died out, their realm quickly began to crumble. The North soon was seized by Latin nobles, while the South was split between the Griko duchies. On Sicily the story was different. The Griko noble council, which had been founded during the Norman occupation and had financed them and even aided their conquest of Sicily in exchange for more influence, seized power. Utterly corrupt and rotten to the core, they terrorized the island for over two decades, until the merchant lords, a new and more chivalrous class of nobles, arose, and chased the greedy tyrants off the island. To prevent the authority slipping back into the notabilities hand, power was split three ways: Firstly the Megas Eparch, an elected life long position, who acts as the duke of the island and is the leader of the military. Then the Merchant council which represents the major factions of the economic elite - the merchant lords, the various guilds and the landholder aristocracy - of the island and which sets the economic and mercantile policies of the nation. And finally there is the Senate, in which local representatives from all over the island vote on legislation and which acts as a check for the Council and the Megas Eparch. The symbiotic relationship between this three institutions has made the island more stable and prosperous than ever."
