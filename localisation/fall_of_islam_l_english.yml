 FALL_OF_ISLAM_DESC:0 "In the years following the conquest of Arabia by the Muslims, many caliphs tried and failed to conquer the great Byzantine and Sassanid empires, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Caliphate and leaving the Arab peoples fractured and disparate. 800 years later, in 1444, due to the many schisms within the Islamic faith, Arabia is shattered; in Anatolia, without the pressure of Muslim invasions, the Byzantines have held their homelands; in northern Africa and the Middle East, Christian kings vie for power in a mess of different denominations; and in Persia, a new Persian dynasty is ready to rise to greatness. Will you lead the Arabs to new greatness, or will you deal them the final blow and relegate the name of the Prophet to the history books?"

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths asserted their control over the peninsula, ruling until the death of the last Visigothic king Agila II. After that, the peninsula descended into chaos, and in 1444, the peninsula is ruled over by hodge-podge realms and pretender states. In the north, the Kingdom of Asturias faces opposition on all sides; in the east, the resurgent Cartagenians seek to reclaim the holdings the Visigoths ruled over; in the south, the Toledans are still reeling from the invasions of the Berber Imwehheden Empire; and in the west the Lusitanians seek to expand their domain, whether that means the conquest of Iberia or of lands overseas. Who will you lead?"
