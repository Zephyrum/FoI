 FALL_OF_ISLAM:0 "Fall of Islam"
 FALL_OF_ISLAM_DESC:0 "In the years following the conquest of Arabia by the Muslims, many caliphs tried and failed to conquer the great Byzantine and Sassanid empires, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Caliphate and leaving the Arab peoples fractured and disparate. 800 years later, in 1444, due to the many schisms within the Islamic faith, Arabia is shattered; in Anatolia, without the pressure of Muslim invasions, the Byzantines have held their homelands; in northern Africa and the Middle East, Christian kings vie for power in a mess of different denominations; and in Persia, a new Persian dynasty is ready to rise to greatness. Will you lead the Arabs to new greatness, or will you deal them the final blow and relegate the name of the Prophet to the history books?"

 IBERIA_BOOKMARK:0 "Iberia: Signs of War"
 IBERIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Iberia is a strange place. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths asserted their control over the peninsula, ruling until the death of the last Visigothic king, Agila II. After that, the peninsula descended into chaos; and in 1444, the peninsula is ruled over by hodge-podge realms and pretender states. In the north, the Kingdom of Asturias faces opposition on all sides; in the east, the resurgent Carthaginians seek to reclaim their ancient holdings the Visigoths and Romans ruled over; in the south, the Toledans are still reeling from the invasions of the now gone Berber Imwehheden Empire; and in the west the Lusitanians seek to expand their domain, whether that means the conquest of Iberia or of lands overseas. Who will you lead to glory?"
 
 PERSIA_BOOKMARK:0 "Middle East: Turkish Boogaloo"
 PERSIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "As the Mongol borders receded, the Ilkhanate collapsed into dozens of competing warlords all around Persia and Mesopotamia. The Afsharids, from their mountainous base in Tehran, successfully asserted control over much of  the Persian Plateau through military brilliance and diplomatic maneuvering, but unification isn't over yet. Further west, an Ilkhanate rump survives as the Jalayirids, barely holding on to their own borders. Turkish states have broken into Anatolia and Egypt during the Mongol era, seemingly here to stay. For all of the Middle East, the ultimate prize is at stake - controlling the routes between the world's two poles of wealth, China and the Mediterranean..."

 CHINA_BOOKMARK:0 "Recently Updated: China"
 CHINA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The lands of the Middle Kingdom are as dynamic and chaotic as ever. In the north, what remains of the once-great Yuan Khaganate holds on for dear life to its territorial possessions and what little influence it has left. Its Khan, Adai Borjigin, is now 55 years old with the security of his heir's succession being questionable at best. In the Central Plains, the up-and-coming Ming eyes the prizes to their north and south, from Khanbaliq to Guangdong. However, they have yet to prove themselves, and face opposition all around them. One such opponent is the warlord Yue Han, with his dominion around the Pearl River delta. The Yue, having finally arranged a codified set of rites for the Chinese folk religion (now called Sixiang), are primed to make their force felt in China and beyond with tactful diplomacy, religious fervor and fierce leadership. As Taisun's reign approaches, the future of the East is at stake."
 
 INDIA_BOOKMARK:0 "Recently Updated: India"
 INDIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "India is a patchwork of religions, traditions, and states all vying to fill the gap left by the decline of the Shahdom of Delhi, founded by Turkic warlords from Central Asia. In Lahore, the Yamag, de facto leader of the Manichaean faith, has been forced to bend the knee to the Shah of Delhi, but how much longer this will remain the case is yet to be seen. Down the Ganges lies the Kingdom of Pala, one of the myriad nations which filled the void. While strong on the surface, many of the Pala are skeptical of the Kingdom's relations with the Buddhists in Tibet, seeing Dharmapala II as a Tibetan puppet. In the southern part of the subcontinent, borderline chaos reigns. Will Delhi regain its former glory? Or will a new suzerain subjugate India?"
