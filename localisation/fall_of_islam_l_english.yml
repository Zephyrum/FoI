 FALL_OF_ISLAM:0 "Fall of Islam"
 FALL_OF_ISLAM_DESC:0 "In the years following the conquest of Arabia by the Muslims, many caliphs tried and failed to conquer the great Byzantine and Sassanid empires, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Caliphate and leaving the Arab peoples fractured and disparate. 800 years later, in 1444, due to the many schisms within the Islamic faith, Arabia is shattered; in Anatolia, without the pressure of Muslim invasions, the Byzantines have held their homelands; in northern Africa and the Middle East, Christian kings vie for power in a mess of different denominations; and in Persia, a new Persian dynasty is ready to rise to greatness. Will you lead the Arabs to new greatness, or will you deal them the final blow and relegate the name of the Prophet to the history books?"

 IBERIA_BOOKMARK:0 "Iberia: Signs of War"
 IBERIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Iberia is a strange place. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths asserted their control over the peninsula, ruling until the death of the last Visigothic king, Agila II. After that, the peninsula descended into chaos; and in 1444, the peninsula is ruled over by hodge-podge realms and pretender states. In the north, the Kingdom of Asturias faces opposition on all sides; in the east, the resurgent Carthaginians seek to reclaim their ancient holdings the Visigoths and Romans ruled over; in the south, the Toledans are still reeling from the invasions of the now gone Berber Imwehheden Empire; and in the west the Lusitanians seek to expand their domain, whether that means the conquest of Iberia or of lands overseas. Who will you lead to glory?"
 
 PERSIA_BOOKMARK:0 "Middle East: Fate of the Flames"
 PERSIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "As the Mongol borders receded, the Ilkhanate collapsed into dozens of competing warlords all around Persia and Mesopotamia. The Afsharids, from their mountainous base in Tehran, successfully asserted control over much of  the Persian Plateau through military brilliance and diplomatic maneuvering, but unification isn't over yet. Further west, an Ilkhanate rump survives as the Jalayirids, barely holding on to their own borders. Turkish states have broken into Anatolia and Egypt during the Mongol era, seemingly here to stay. For all of the Middle East, the ultimate prize is at stake - controlling the routes between the world's two poles of wealth, China and the Mediterranean..."

 CHINA_BOOKMARK:0 "China: Age of Warlords"
 CHINA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The lands of the Middle Kingdom are as dynamic and chaotic as ever. In the north, what remains of the once-great Yuan Khaganate holds on for dear life to its territorial possessions and what little influence it has left. Its Khan, Adai Borjigin, is now 55 years old with the security of his heir's succession being questionable at best. In the Central Plains, the up-and-coming Ming eyes the prizes to their north and south, from Khanbaliq to Guangdong. However, they have yet to prove themselves, and face opposition all around them. One such opponent is the warlord Yue Han, with his dominion around the Pearl River delta. The Yue, having finally arranged a codified set of rites for the Chinese folk religion (now called Sixiang), are primed to make their force felt in China and beyond with tactful diplomacy, religious fervor and fierce leadership. As Taisun's reign approaches, the future of the East is at stake."
 
 INDIA_BOOKMARK:0 "India: Sunset of the Shahs"
 INDIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Arrival of the Manichaean Shahs into the subcontinent led to the demise of the old order of the north. From this rubble emerged the Shahdom of Delhi, the strongest state in the region since the time of the Gupta Empire. This strength would lead to its downfall from constant Kartid raids, multiple civil wars and, an invasion from the Tibetan kingdom. As a result, a myriad of new states would form each vying for control over the north. While from within the shahdom, powerful subjects seek greater autonomy or outright independence. Meanwhile, the kingdom of Karnata has been able to conquer the Deccan plateau due to building upon the new foreign ideas of the northern shahs. With the decline of Rayalaseema, the kingdom of Tamilakam has been able to reemerge as a regional power. Will the king of Tamilakam or the Shah of Delhi be able to restore their respective realms to their form glory? or will a new suzerain subjugate the subcontinent?"

 BARBARIE_BOOKMARK:0 "Barbarie: Stardust Crusaders"
 BARBARIE_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The centuries-long conflicts, that plagued the Barbarie, seem to be finally coming to an end. The Teachings of the prophet Tadmun, and the following anti-Tadmunite crusades, the fall of the Imwehheden and the counter attack of the Iberians have splinted the region into a patchwork of competing Berber kingdoms and crusader states, and it wont take long, until one of them will ascend to a dominant position in this chaos. In the west, the tadmunite kingdom of Mauritania has managed to keep the last few decades relatively peaceful, by trying to mostly keep religion out of politics, but especially along the coast, resistence is growing among the Catholics against the unwanted rule. Meanwhile, in the East, the crusader state of Carthage continually gains more and more power. How will the future of this region look like?"
 
 BALKANS_BOOKMARK:0 "Balkans: Clash of Eagles"
 BALKANS_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "For hundreds of years, the Balkans were the battlefield of empires. In the constant back and forth between the Holy Roman Emperor, the Basileus in Byzantium and the Bulgar empire, the lands of the Croats, Bosnians and Serbians, of the Arberians, Dacians and Cumans have been nothing more than chess pieces. But the times seem to be changing. The balance has shifted, and both the Orthodox empires of Greece and Bulgaria seem to be shaken, while the Emperor in Prague is growing stronger. Like the establishment of the Grand Duchy of Zagreb clearly shows, nowadays the wind blows from north-west. All the small and broken duchies can finally see their chance, to take over from the old empires. Even in Anatolia, the position of the Byzantines is not so sure anymore. Can the old titans recover, or will a new eagle rise from the ashes of the Balkans?"
