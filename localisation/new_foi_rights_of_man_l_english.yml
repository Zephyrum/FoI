Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

Most of our Viziers feel it is our duty to uphold our dynastic tradition of appointing our sons to act as governors and rulers over small provinces. This way they can learn what it is to be a ruler. By assigning suitably powerful provinces we can also reduce the chance of a future succession struggle. [sancaga_cikma_province.GetName] has served as such a governorship at times in the past and would likely fit [Root.Heir.GetName] very well.\nOthers, including our Mother, the Kayzerlik Ana, feel that young [Root.Heir.GetName] would benefit the most from an education within the walls of the Imperial Harem, where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will have constant access to good teachers and can be supervised by those who know him.

As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is still in good health, and as we have not allowed our heir to actually take to the field, the realization of this dream remains an uncertainty. It has come to the point that [Root.Heir.GetName] is being ridiculed by the other Kayzade and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother is imploring [Root.Monarch.GetName] to give [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a command of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own.\nThis is not an unreasonable request, though one must wonder about the motives of those that try to goad our favorite to risk [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] life and limb."
