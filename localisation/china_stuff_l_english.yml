After successive splits from dynastic conflict and border tribes abandoning their duties, the Khagan's title held very little of the original lands. Yet, now, we stand in an excellent position to remind the world that we're the heirs and legacy of Chagatai Khan!"

 sina.1d:0 "The Imperial Court is usually tasked with educating the next sons of the Heaven for rule, however, as of late, the court of the Great Yuan has been less and less trustworthy, specially since the Khan's reforms suppressed some of their power. Perhaps it is time for our ruler to take control of his son's education?"

 sina.2t:0 "Ming challenges central authority"

The situation is that Nestorianism has been getting increasingly popular in the region. Reacting to this, peasants have started adopting the cult of the Four Symbols as a way to show their pride in their culture and refusal to adopt a foreign deity all across China. Of course, Confucianism is still very much part of our core values, and abandoning it might not be wise."

 ###Sixiang Pulse Events###
 
 sixiang_events.1t:0 "Ritual Syncretism"
 sixiang_events.1d:0 "Locals in (province name) have worshipped our four symbols as part of their native deities for a long time. Many in Asia have, in fact - our reformation is more of an estabilishment of rites and morals rather than a new set of deities. It's been a major factor in softening the cultural impact and making it easy for newly conquered regions to adapt."
 sixiang_events.1a:0 "Excellent news."
 
 sixiang_events.2t:0 "Intricate weaver in [Root.GetName]"
 sixiang_events.2d:0 "A local symbolist in (province name) has taken it upon himself to weave silken robes with some of the finest artwork of our deities embedded throught it. The local governor was very impressed, and contacted (monarch name) recommending to commission a piece from him."
 sixiang_events.2a:0 "I'll take two!"
 sixiang_events.2b:0 "I'll pass."
 
 sixiang_events.3t:0 "Astrologer spreads panic!"
 sixiang_events.3d:0 "Grave news. An astrologer has read the signs and reached a nasty conclusion. He rambled about how the constellations aligned in the same way that precede widespread misfortune, the details of which seemed like a fairy tale on it's own. What's worse, he wasn't content with just alerting us, he felt the need to go around the provinces spreading the news of an ill fate to come."
 sixiang_events.3a:0 "Misfortune? Oh no!"
 sixiang_events.3b:0 "Wait, spreading the news? Stop that mad man!"
 
 sixiang_events.4t:0 "Dragon sighted!"
 sixiang_events.4d:0 "Sire, we have reports that peasants have spotted a great blue dragon flying across the sky. We cannot confirm such, nor do we know where it was headed to, and, quite frankly, there is a good chance that is was just a comet. Thankfully, it seems most of them interpreted it as a sign of a good omen to come."
 sixiang_events.4a:0 "It's a good omen!"
 sixiang_events.4b:0 "The end is nigh for our enemies!"
 sixiang_events.4c:0 "It'll help the economy!"
 sixiang_events.4do:0 "Hahaha! Thank the Heavens we live in such enlightened times!"
 sixiang_events.4e:0 "Oh Dragon, Azulong's kith and kin..."
 
 sixiang_events.5t:0 "Court disagrees on deity"
 sixiang_events.5d:0 "Having more than one deity means our court sometimes have their petty squabbles grow in proportion due to two arguing parties also disagreeing on their patron deity. Several courtiers have been (not so quietly) provoking each other, and whenever the deities' names get involved, it just gets worse and worse."
 sixiang_events.5a:0 "Get them out of here!"
 sixiang_events.5b:0 "You're both missing the point of the faith!"
 
 sixiang_events.6t:0 "Rites Rejected!"
 sixiang_events.6d:0 "Our faith was little more than a loose collection of beliefs and deities with too little to make sure the people were truly being faithful. We've since estabilished a set of rites through reform, thus becoming the religion we hold dear. However, some claim that our rites are either too strict compared to the "good old times" or that there should be no rites at all, for a man's worth should not be measured in how he prays, but in the fact that he prays to begin with."
 sixiang_events.6a:0 "Well, it's a good point."
 sixiang_events.6b:0 "Heresy."
 
 sixiang_events.7t:0 "Zodiac good for [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 sixiang_events.7d:0 "Astrologers constantly check the stars for signs of what the Gods have in wait for us, and one of them decided to compare the layout of the stars to the ones that define [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s signs. Thankfully it seems that we are blessed, for [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is, at least according to the stars above, going to see through an age of prosperity."
 sixiang_events.7a:0 "Blessed be the Heavens!"
 
 sixiang_events.8t:0 "Zodiac bad for [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 sixiang_events.8d:0 "Astrologers constantly check the stars for signs of what the Gods have in wait for us, and one of them decided to compare the layout of the stars to the ones that define [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s signs. Unfortunately, we're in for a hard time, as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s signs point towards an age of scarcity and times of trouble."
 sixiang_events.8a:0 "It is the will of the Heavens."
 
 sixiang_events.9t:0 "Sculpture becomes local artifact"
 sixiang_events.9d:0 "An old sculpture in $PROVINCENAME$ of spiritual significance has gained increased fame in it's neighboring areas. It's a pretty sight, crafted before our rites were estabilished, and now is gaining tract as a symbol of local allegiance to the deities. The locals have sent a missive to us, and expect us to somehow provide patronage to $PROVINCENAME$."
 sixiang_events.9a:0 "Make it a pilgrimage center!"
 sixiang_events.9b:0 "Collect tithes from it!"
 
 sixiang_events.10t:0 "Prominent local scholar"
 sixiang_events.10d:0 "Out countryside has given birth to a skilled scholar, albeit a modest one, well read and well versed in the rites. Normally, we strictly only recruit bureaucrats that have passed our entrance tests, but this one's promising talent has left us assured that he is up to the job. We could have him go through the test, too, but then, we'll have lesser favor on the man."
 sixiang_events.10a:0 "We can make an exception for the gifted."
 sixiang_events.10b:0 "We can't set a bad precedent."

 yue_nanman_desc: "The Southern lands of the Middle Kingdom are a growing center of farming and trade, and we've taken a lead over the competition in our early campaigns and support from converted villages. We're still quite a ways away from our dreams, though - we'll have to maintain such pace."

 shu_pacification_of_nanzhong_desc: "South of us lays a province that has been a particularly rebellious throughout history.

 min_3: "Foreign Embassies"
 min_3_desc: "Most rulers of Middle Kingdom have seen themselves as invencible and never thought foreigners had anything of value.

 min_4: "Junker Expeditions"

 qin_2: "Power Checks"

 qin_3: "Unprecedented Religious Conflicts"
 qin_3_desc: "As religions poured in from the Silk Road, our old traditions were displaced or altered beyond belief. We felt the shock moreso than anyone else, for being at the doorstep of the road.

 jin_2: "Loyalty above all"
 jin_2_desc: "The key word behind the fall of Empires is a lack of loyalty. If you can't trust someone, you shouldn't let them grow in power. This is basic, but many don't seem to catch on. The Yuan sure didn't."
 jin_3: "Open up a Bureau of Barbarians"
 jin_3_desc: "Being on the dangerous Northern frontier of the Middle Kingdom has the amazing 'benefit' of getting raided all of the time by all of the tribal peoples up North. They calmed down during Mongol rule (since they were part of the same state), but if the Mongols lose their way, it's best to make sure we know how to handle their politics for our interest."
 jin_4: "Intellectuals at Court"
 jin_4_desc: "It's important for the continued function of the state that it is manned by a capable bureaucracy of the greatest minds of the age."
 jin_5: "Eight Gates Formation"
 jin_5_desc: "A defensive attack formation devised in a previous warlord age, it focuses on slow yet well-planned movement that ensures our men are taking the least amount of damage possible, is solid enough to protect the flanks, and has no obvious weaknesses."
 jin_6: "Tuntian System"
 jin_6_desc: "This system, devised by distant ancestors of our Dynasty, was created to fill in an army quickly and supply it efficiently, by assuring every able-bodied man in an assigned area is either farming or serving. It's strict, so it must be kept for periods of prolonged war. But it's efficient."
 jin_7: "The Great Wall"
 jin_7_desc: "Perhaps one of the greatest legacies that the Middle Kingdom has left for us - and we will leave for whoever succeeds us - is the Great Wall. It protects our lands from direct attacks from barbarians of all kinds, as a massive deterrent first, and a gigantic obstacle second. This marvel of engineering shall not disappoint us."

 chagatayid_ideas_bonus: "Chagatai Khaganate Ambition"
 
 chagatayid_1: "Advanced Logistics"
 chagatayid_1_desc: "When the Mongol Empire was first split, the Chagatai Khaganate was left with the landlocked regions of Central Asia, a large part of which is dry or outright arid. War logistics in the region are more complex, and, thus, we've slowly learned to handle it."
 chagatayid_2: "The Mongol Ways"
 chagatayid_2_desc: "The Mongols did not fall because they fell obsolete at the art of war, but for administrative and diplomatic issues. Their ways are still a strong method of achieving great victories."
 chagatayid_3: "Glory of the Bloodline"
 chagatayid_3_desc: "The Chagatayids descend from Chagatai Khan, a son of Genghis, which, by extension, makes the Chagatai Khagans direct heirs to Genghis and his legacy."
 chagatayid_4: "Control of the Silk Road"
 chagatayid_4_desc: "The land route of the Silk Road passes straight through Chagatai territory, and alternative land routes are simply not viable. This can be used for our economic advantage."
 chagatayid_5: "Central Asian Divergences"
 chagatayid_5_desc: "Central Asia is home to many different faiths, such as Nestorianism, Buddhism, Tengriism and Manicheanism. A ruler unwilling to compromise in such a location is ill-prepared to lead these peoples."
 chagatayid_6: "Destiny of the Bloodline"
 chagatayid_6_desc: "It's in our destiny to reclaim glory that can compete with that of our predecessors of Temujin, Chagatai and Esen Buqa Khans. Let's walk into the future with the goal of honoring those who brought us here by outdoing them."
 chagatayid_7: "Ressuscitate Mongol Influence"
 chagatayid_7_desc: "Our rebirth as the major power of Central Asia is merely a step towards the reunification of the Great Mongol Empire. All of it is bound to return to our hands at some point."

 min_mission_3_desc:0 "We've long known about the existence of Taiwan, an island not far from our coasts. Yet, now, our people's lust for new lands to tame sees Taiwan as an easy potential target."
 
 min_mission_4_title:0 "Hold the South Seas"
 min_mission_4_desc:0 "Taking control of the trade flux in the seas is important for our profits to keep flowing. Taiwan and the mainland are good starting points, but we need to go even further out to maximize gains."
 
 min_mission_5_title:0 "Colonial Subjects"
 min_mission_5_desc:0 "Our tendency to settle in overseas territories has been an excellent endeavor thus far. Let's make sure to go farther than any Han has ever before and forge an empire second to our own in distant lands!"

 a_new_court_desc:0 "If our ambitions are to grow into the new leaders of the Han people, first and foremost, we need to have a city whose grandness matches our goals."
 
 levy_prefectures_title:0 "Levy the Prefects"
 levy_prefectures_desc:0 "While the status of prefectures have been messy as the central authority collapsed, they still exist, and prefects are still in charge of our subdivisions. We must request their assistance."
 
 chinese_industriousness_title:0 "Chinese Industry"
 chinese_industriousness_desc:0 "The Han people are the source of the Silk Road, and are known for large scale rice farms. Industriousness runs in our very blood. This'll be the key to our economic expansion."

 unite_political_centers_desc:0 "As we grow stronger, we must not forget the cities that, in the past, have been the centers of our history. Their importance cannot be understated, as, on top of the wealth they generate, they also bring recognition for our diplomatic moves."
