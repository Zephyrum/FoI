 yue_nanman_desc: "The Southern lands of the Middle Kingdom are a growing center of farming and trade, and we've taken a lead over the competition in our early campaigns and support from converted villages. We're still quite a ways away from our dreams, though - we'll have to maintain such pace."

To this day, the very mention of the enemy general causes shivering within our ranks, and our children are told his name in horror stories.

 wu_idea_6_desc: "It has been a tradition at this point to recruit willing pirates to the ranks of the Wu army and navy.

 wu_idea_7: "Repel the Northerners"
 wu_idea_7_desc: "Wu has driven away all sorts of invaders from the North multiple times. Like we defeated our old rivals at the Red Cliffs, we will not let the Yuan, Ming or any other petty warlord to subjugate us."

 chagatayid_7_desc: "Our rebirth as the major power of Central Asia is merely a step towards the reunification of the Great Mongol Empire. All of it is bound to return to our hands at some point."
