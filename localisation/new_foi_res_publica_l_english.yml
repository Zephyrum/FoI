 dutch_republic.2.dc:0 "One of the [Root.GetName]'s most respected advisors, $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$TRADER$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, has recently published a work discussing the political principles the confederation form of government depends on. While certainly well written and convincingly argued, some of the material is strongly critical of the hold the Begs of [Root.GetName] have had on the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] recently. The advisor's loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetName] may be less unwavering than we thought."
 dutch_republic.2.c:0 "Counterpoints to the status quo are vital to our confederation."
 dutch_republic.4.da:0 "With a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] like [Root.Monarch.GetName], most nobles agree that there is no need for elections, which would only destabilize and weaken the [Root.GetAdjective] nation. Many traders disagree. They find the institutions of the confederation, including elections, to be crucial in ensuring [Root.GetName]'s continued economic priorities.\n\nUnder an autocratic [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with expansionistic ambitions, the free trade and liberty they have enjoyed in the past may be threatened. If the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is to rule for life, they demand that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] shows dedication to these ideals."
 dutch_republic.6.dc:0 "Although still maintaining a hold on the position of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rule over [Root.GetName], the influence of the Feudalists has fallen slightly in recent times. Nobles who sought power by aligning themselves with the family are increasingly coming to view this as a sign that the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], despite its legacy, is still at the mercy of the bureaucracy and political environment of the confederation.\n\nSome of those who have formed the backbone of our armed forces are requesting that [Root.Monarch.GetName] commits to asserting power more clearly in military matters. None of their suggestions contribute to very constructive purposes, but may impress the old guard."
 dutch_republic.7.dc:0 "Despite the monopoly the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family holds on the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.GetName] has seen a current of confederate ideals recently. Confederationists have viewed this as a sign that our nation may very well be on its way towards their goal of a full-fledged confederation, with some even going as far as praising the Beg of [Root.GetName] for permitting this shift. Regardless of how much truth there is to this, our recent political maneuvering keeps the dream of the [Root.GovernmentName] alive."
 dutch_republic.8.dc:0 "The Feudalists already wield great influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] rule, and the latest developments in the political arena have only served to strengthen their grip on our state. Some of our previously loyal subjects have taken this as a sign that the priorities of [Root.GetName] have shifted and that a time is coming when tax money will be wasted on vain pursuits of noble families. Down this road, they claim, lie only petty wars and tyranny. In protest, many people are refusing to pay taxes to support this government."
 dutch_republic.9.dc:0 "The reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is all but absolute. The Begs have secured power over [Root.GetName] for a long time ahead. Everything points to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ruling for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire life.\n\n$SPYMASTER$, one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors, agrees with this assessment. This is a person fiercely loyal to their country, so loyal, in fact, that they would personally take the life of anyone who threatens the confederation. In a recent meeting with a few carefully selected people, $SPYMASTER$ let it be known that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self and the Feudalist' stranglehold on the rulership is perhaps the biggest threat of all. $SPYMASTER$ can assure that the lifetime rule will be a short one."
 dutch_republic.9.c:0 "We must act, for the confederate cause."

 #dutch_republic.11.t:0 "Suggest Act of Seclusion"
 #dutch_republic.11.d:0 "There is peace between us and the Dutch confederation... for now. The final terms of the truce were largely agreed upon when the war ended, but some room for negotiation still remains. We know that the current rulers are interested in weakening the position of the Orangists, a faction within the confederation seeking to grant power to a house of nobles.\n\nIf we were to put forward a suggestion for an Act to keep the next Beg of Orange away from political power, it could serve both to improve our diplomacy with the current administration and ensure that there won't be a Qan on their throne to lead them into another war against us."
 #dutch_republic.11.a:0 "This would be a good way to start anew."
 #dutch_republic.11.a.tt:0 "Suggest the agreement to [This.GetName]."
 #dutch_republic.11.b:0 "We have no reason to support the current administration."
 #dutch_republic.12.t:0 "Act of Seclusion"
 #dutch_republic.12.d:0 "The war with [From.GetName] was over, we thought all matters were settled. Negotiations have drawn out over some minor issues, but everything changed this week, when [From.GetAdjective] representatives suggested a new clause. To our surprise, one favorable to the confederation.\n\nTo weaken the Orange family's position politically, they want us to pass an Act to keep future Begs of Orange from the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. What motive they have for this is not yet clear, but even if such an Act may not last forever, it would considerably strengthen the Confederationist rule... if this is handled with discretion."
 #dutch_republic.12.a:0 "We know how to be discrete."
 #dutch_republic.12.b:0 "It's unthinkable that we'd accept such a demand from our enemies!"

 dutch_republic.13.dc:0 "[Root.GetName] may be a confederation, but we still maintain enough power through blood for marriage ties to be a factor in our relationship with other nations. Even so, the more fluid the rulership, the less tangible these ties become.\n\nNations who are normally pleased with the Confederationist administration now worry about the prospect that their ties to the [Root.GetAdjective] powers may be weakening as the nation leaves its hereditary traditions behind. They want to make sure influential families retain some power... including the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family."
 dutch_republic.14.dc:0 "The Confederationist rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust the [Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also a Feudalist, to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this young person seems like a talented commandant, we would loathe giving them influence."
 dutch_republic.16.da:0 "The Confederationist rule has strengthened recently, which we can only interpret as a sign that the confederation is the future. The successes of [Root.GetName], the increased trade economy and qualified administration, could only have happened to a confederation of provinces like ours.\n\nBy giving up some of the dictatorial control the Qans of old insisted on, we have achieved things that would have been impossible for them. Now is the time to show our confidence in these ideas by relinquishing some of our control in favor of freedom."
 dutch_republic.16.c:0 "Confederationism is an idea worth our dedication."
 dutch_republic.17.c:0 "We'll show them that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is as strong as any Monarch."
 dutch_republic.18.dc:0 "The victory of the opposition in the latest struggles between Confederationist and Feudalists interests has turned out to unexpectedly benefit [Root.GetName]. Nobles who had taken modest interest in military matters before are now hoping for a future where a Beg of [Root.GetName] can lead our people to glory. They see a bright and proud future for the [Root.GetAdjective] confederation, and whether or not they are right, this will benefit our military with much-needed leadership."
 dutch_republic.19.dc:0 "Confederate rule is frequently about compromise, finding a middle ground so a decision can be made. Sometimes, it isn't. In the last conflict between Feudalists and Confederationist interests, when the administration came out victorious, some nobles saw this as a sign that the confederation rulers have grown unreasonable and presumptuous.\n\nMorale among the soldiers in our nation may remain high, but some generals are losing faith in the [Root.GetAdjective] cause. Wrong as they might be, our military strength will suffer from their lacking leadership."
 dutch_republic.20.dc:1 "[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] is a person of action. That is why [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] was employed by the administration and how [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] has continued to hold the position as [Root.GetName]'s chief military advisor despite being a well-known supporter of the Feudalist cause. Now, their actions have turned against us.\n\nClaiming that the unquestioned strength of the Confederationists is ruining [Root.GetName], [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] has rallied others who find their power threatened by the ruling faction behind [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim] and is attempting to stage a coup and take power. Now it is up to us to take action or to let this happen."
 dutch_republic.20.e:0 "For the Qanate!"
 dutch_republic.20.f:0 "For the Confederacy!"
 dutch_republic.21.da:0 "In certain questions in the Senate, compromise is required for the [Root.GovernmentName] to operate efficiently. When the representatives can't come to an agreement, our nation can't be governed. Our efforts to ensure that [Root.GetName] can't be ruled centrally with an iron fist have been successful; however, this also means that consensus has to be arranged through political maneuvering rather than authority. Sometimes, it can't be arranged at all."
 dutch_republic.22.da:0 "Throughout the ages, war has often been the time when the rule of the many gave way to the rule of the few. Being aware of this, we are reluctant to make too many concessions in power to the military even now that our nation goes to battle.\n\nA general who has been crucial in our successes so far, at least in his own version of events, is now in conflict with representatives of the [Root.GovernmentName] on the future course of action. His military expertise is beyond question, but strong-arming Confederationists to go along with his plans would weaken their political position in [Root.GetName]."
 dutch_republic.22.c:0 "The Senate will have to comply to ensure victory."
 dutch_republic.25.da:0 "The war took its toll on [Root.GetName]. The people fought hard, and while some may feel pride in the scars our confederation will carry from this struggle, more have been reminded of the brutality of warfare. The Confederationists see a chance to seek support for their cause among those who share these sentiments, arguing that a True confederation need not go to war and has no wish to. This could alleviate concerns people have about the future, but that future would likely belong to the Confederationists."
 dutch_republic.25.dd:0 "The Beg of [Root.GetName] could lead us to victory in the future."
 dutch_republic.26.da:0 "[Root.GetName] has been a key point for merchants and international trade for as long as anyone can remember, but the key to this success has been a point of contention. Recently, an economic theorist from the area has argued, in his work 'Interest of [Root.GetName] and the motives for its prosperity', that the confederation government form is part of the reason the province has thrived, suggesting that with the right political environment, this good fortune could spread throughout [Root.Owner.GetName]."
 dutch_republic.27.da:2 "Some in our nation's frontier provinces look across the border with pride or ambitions of conquest. Others with fear. Bordering a nation which may threaten our sovereignty has led some influential local leaders to support Confederationist agendas in the [Root.GovernmentName], hoping to avoid a Beg leading the nation who may seek to expand the [Root.GetAdjective] borders and cause unnecessary conflict with our stronger neighbor."
 dutch_republic.28.dc:0 "Being a border province does not seem to be a cause for concern among the nobles of [Root.GetName]. Conversely, they believe that our neighbors should be the ones to be concerned, as we might very well decide that their lands would be better off under the rule of [Root.GetName] or as Generality Lands of the confederation. The people across the border seem to have seen this coming, since they appear to fear the might of [Root.Owner.GetName], particularly with an ambitious Beg of [Root.GetName] in power."
 dutch_republic.29.da:1 "Having to share a border with a nation we have declared open rivalry and hostility against could lead people to be contemptuous, but the good citizens of [Root.GetCapitalName] have managed to hide their contempt well.\n\nInstead, the local nobles have secretly started to draft plans of expansion into the lands of our enemy, plans that they believe might be put into action if [Root.Owner.GetName] would only have a leader who thought of the nation's glory first and political games second. They have little respect for the efforts of confederates, but believe that the Beg might support their ambitions."
 dutch_republic.29.c:0 "War is the concern of the Senate, not of local nobles."

 cuman_republic.1.t:0 "Sermons for Begs" #3
 cuman_republic.1.d:0 "Popular support for the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is strengthened from the pulpit of the [Root.Religion.GetName] church, where the common folk are often reminded of the great importance of a strong ruler for the state church and the tradition of hereditary rule.\n\n[Root.GetName], however, accommodates more than one faith. Those who adhere to other faiths don't always have kind words for the Begs of [Root.GetName], with some using our confederation ideals as an excuse to openly challenge the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the state church."
 cuman_republic.2.t:0 "The Qan in [Root.GetName]" #5
 cuman_republic.2.d:0 "The House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has enjoyed increased support in [Root.GetName] lately. As a result, their proponents have grown bolder. Those within the church speak of the Begs of [Root.GetName] in royal terms, comparing them to ancient biblical Kings. Our people have not forgotten their role in securing our nation's sovereignty and being praised as the last in a line of saviors certainly benefits [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Nevertheless, calling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a Qan, even in the context of a sermon, risks weakening our confederation institutions."
 cuman_republic.3.t:0 "Confederation Ideals Betrayed" #10
 cuman_republic.3.d:0 "The Begs of [Root.GetName] command almost unquestioned loyalty. Elections seem to be a thing of the past, despite our nation featuring concepts akin to a confederation. The Confederationists are no longer the only ones who question the integrity of confederation institutions in [Root.GetName]; rather, it's growing increasingly uncommon to refer to these concepts at all. However noble the goals of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the underpinnings of our government form are slipping away."
 cuman_republic.4.t:0 "Nobles Look to the Beg of [Root.GetName]" #15
 cuman_republic.4.d:0 "Belief in the virtue of hereditary power tends to be strong among those who have themselves inherited their power. Local nobles in [Root.GetName] don't see that connection and argue that their wish to see the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in power is grounded in their concern for national unity and stability.\n\nGoverning those who don't believe in what we are trying to achieve is not easy. Sometimes direct conflict cannot be avoided. Sometimes it can be avoided, but at a price."
 cuman_republic.5.t:0 "A Country Without a Qan" #17
 cuman_republic.5.d:0 "The recent increase in support for the Feudalists faction has sparked a discussion about how our [Root.GovernmentName] is viewed by other nations. A country with a weak monarch may be regarded as easy prey and unworthy of respect. What does this mean for a country lacking a monarch altogether?\n\nThe Feudalists claim to have the answer. For our nation to be a contender on the international arena, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to unite and rule. Vain power displays are normally considered a waste, but perhaps one would be necessary now."
 cuman_republic.6.t:0 "Feudalists Rally Nobles To War" #23
 cuman_republic.6.d:0 "We are at war, but not just any war. Our enemy is not only one of current circumstance, but a hated rival of [Root.GetName]. At times such as this, the provinces are united against a common threat, and nobles are eager to lead them into battle. Who better to lead than the Beg of [Root.GetName]?\n\nWhile allowing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to rally other nobles and the common people to war would strengthen combat morale, the Confederationists are not fools. They know that the effects of this unity will linger beyond the war and that Feudalists will be reluctant to let go of any power they are granted, even for the best of causes."
 cuman_republic.6.a:0 "The House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has led our nation to victory before."
 cuman_republic.6.b:0 "We cannot forsake the confederation cause for this."
 cuman_republic.7.t:0 "Confederationists Demand Return to Status Quo" #24
 cuman_republic.7.d:0 "The war is over, greatly aided by the efforts of the Feudalists, who are still enjoying popular support from these actions and retaining much of the power granted to them. Confederationists who were willing to make concessions to the family during wartime are now demanding a return to how things were before the war. Anything less, they argue, would be tantamount to giving control over the country to whoever leads it into battle, throwing away the representative institutions the confederation is so proud of."
