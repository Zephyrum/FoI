 #Descriptions

 lus_conquer_galicia_desc:0 "Up north lies a land with peoples that share many of our customs and a similar language. The time has come to integrate them."
 lus_naval_comms_desc:0 "Since our conquest of Macaronesia, we've been lacking an appropriately sized navy to communicate with the settlers there. We should rectify that."
 lus_exploration_bases_desc:0 "Now that we estabilished appropriate connections between our homeland and our colonies, we should build up one of the islands to have a fair-sized town for a naval base."
 lus_discover_america_desc:0 "It's time we set sail westwards and look for new land, be it islands or an entirely new continent."
 lus_colonial_endeavors_desc:0 "We have succesfully discovered a whole new world! We must secure a foothold there for the glory of Lusitania!"
 lus_wood_and_dyes_desc:0 "Down south lies a large jungle with a unique tree with a shade of red in it's trunk. Nod only is the wood of high quality, but it also provides us with a ember-like dye. We shall name it after it's ember-like color - 'Pau-Brasil'."
 lus_inca_desc:0 "Reports indicate a fully settled civilization lives in the mountains on the other side of the New World. Even without horses, they have large roads sprawling through the mountains. And, more importantly, silver. Lots of it. Let's take it all!"
 lus_mastery_of_coins_desc:0 "If we succesfully control both the gold from Mexico and silver from Peru, we will have a steady supply of coverage for our currency! We will be able to master inflation and bend markets to our will!"
 lus_foothold_desc:0 "We can initiate operations to take over territories in Africa, much like the Berbers once did in Iberia, if we manage to secure a port."
 lus_northern_morocco_desc:0 "The strait of Gades is too strategically important to not be in our hands. Let us take all of the Mauretanian coast!"
 lus_monopolize_atlantic_desc:0 "The Mauretanians have been tested by us, and they were weak. It's time we remove their access to the coast - we don't need to penetrate inland to penetrate their markets."
 lus_close_mediterranean_desc:0 "Controlling both sides of the Straits of Gades will allow us to block entrance and exit for merchants from other nations!"
 lus_sweet_sugar_desc:0 "The Caraíbas seem to have all of the perfect characteristics to produce sugar in a large scale, even more so than the Macaronesian islands! We must not let this opportunity pass!"
 lus_mexico_desc:0 "The warrior peoples of the so-called 'Mexico' built a massive city in the center of a lake during their breaks from making human sacrifices. It looks pretty, therefore we should take it for ourselves."
 lus_build_up_army_desc:0 "Iberia is a powder keg. We cannot show weakness, let us levy our men and prepare ourselves for an inevitable war that is coming along."
 lus_leon_desc:0 "The lands of the crown of Leão are quite wealthy and will serve to expand our influence in Iberia. It is decidly the next step in our conquests."
 lus_battle_for_badajoz_desc:0 "Badajoz and Hispális have long been a goal for Lusitanian leaders. Their wealth is massive and a good chunk of the money that comes in and out of Iberia comes from there."
 lus_crush_cartagena_desc:0 "Cartagena's aggressive and militaristic behavior cannot be tolerated. We must strike before they do to ensure a safe border."
 lus_other_side_desc:0 "Across the peninsula stands Valência, proudly. A large city for those with large ambitions, taking control of it will safeguard the eastern entrepot of Iberia."
 lus_block_others_desc:0 "At this point, we should just annex the entire northern coast of Iberia to ensure permanent Lusitanian naval supremacy."
 lus_inland_endeavors_desc:0 "We have secured the ports. The inland crowns are deprived of their source of wealth. The time is ripe to push inland."
 lus_central_mountains_desc:0 "At the heart of Iberia, mountains make for a difficult obstacle for conquerors, but we believe we can safely lay siege to these inner territories and become the masters of the mountains ourselves."
 lus_iberia_unification_desc:0 "No one else stands in our way. We rule as the strongest nation in Iberia by far. We shall seal the fate of all those who remain opposing us!"
 lus_olisipo_desc:0 "Olisipo is a respectable city on it's own, but has lacked appropriate effort to expand it's wealth. With some resettling and investing, we will turn it into a metropolis the likes of Paris!"
 lus_vinho_do_porto_desc:0 "The wine from Porto is of the best quality. Perhaps we should invest more into it's production to ensure we have enough to sell to all those willing to buy this delicious drink."
 lus_southern_entrepot_desc:0 "Silves is very strategically positioned. Unfortunately, it's size does not match our expectations, let alone our needs. We must build up infrastructure for it to become the next great center of Iberian wealth."
 lus_aragon_desc:0 "A mountainous duchy that separates us from the western coast, Aragão is yet another barrier for us to overcome."
 lus_naval_comms_tt:0 "Have a fleet of at least §Y25§! ships."

 per_khorasan_desc:0 "Khorasan is the gateway to the East, and contains the great fire temple of Sabzevar, Azarburzin. For these reasons, control of Khorasan directly or indirectly is prudent."
 per_caspian_coast_desc:0 "The Caspian is the largest inland sea in the known world, and a hub for trade in the Near East. More of its coastline under our control would serve as a commercial stimulant."
 per_religious_unity_desc:0 "Our nations has faced challenge after challenge, many centered around the religions of our people. However, with the Nestorian Rebellion at an end, we can safely say that we are unified in faith."
 per_places_of_worship_desc:0 "Truly we are devout; this has been the case for as long as our empire has existed. We must show our devotion by constructing temples for our people."
 per_persian_trade_desc:0 "The marketplaces of the south shore of the Caspian Sea receive traders from as far east as China. A monopoly on the trade here would certainly boost our economy."

 per_anatolia_desc:0 "Asia Minor, ancient site of the satrapy of Sparda, has fallen into the hands of other powers, pretenders to the Lydian throne. We must reassert Persian control!"
 per_caucasus_desc:0 "The ancient kingdom of Armenia served as a vassal to our ancestors, the Parthians. Now, however, the region is divided between nomadic hordes and decentralized kingdoms. There needs to be a strong ruler on the Armenian throne; a ruler that, naturally, must be Persian."

 per_baluchistan_desc:0 "Balochestan straddles the border between Eran and India and has for centuries changed hands between powers from those regions regularly. Our conquest of the region would serve two purposes: establishing that the region is firmly Persian, and preparing us for an eventual incursion into the lands of India."
 per_indian_trade_desc:0 "With control of the endpoint of Indian and Spice Islands trade, our focus shifts to the origin of the goods traded in Hormuz."
 per_transoxiana_desc:0 "The land of the Turkmens, inbetween the Aral and Caspian seas is nearly inhospitable, a vast desert with few trading posts and oases. Nevertheless, control of this land is imperative if we are to protect against attacks from the hordes of the north."

However, the lands of Khorasan are religiously diverse. Various sects of Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and even Sun worship are present in our lands and the lands near us.

 # Ming - Descriptions

 mng_imp_eco_desc:0 "If we are to truly call ourselves Emperors of China someday, we must make sure that our economy can sustain our army, navy, and bureaucracy. If we cannot manage this, then the Mongol Menace will get the last laugh."
 mng_great_wall_desc:0 "The Great Wall was used for centuries by the dynasties of past to keep the Jurchen and Mongol hordes out of China. Clearly, that didn't work well enough when Genghis Khan marched around it. If we are to prevent a Mongol resurgence or, potentially, a Manchurian threat, we should rebuild the wall and expand its defenses."
 mng_south_china_desc:0 "With the conquest of Southern China, the region has been left devastated by warfare and religious conflicts over the past few decades. Along with this, as comes with any conquest the peoples of the south likely view us as conquerors rather than liberators. We should amend this by investing heavily in the South to revitalize the region's economy and quality of life."
 mng_eastern_trade_desc:0 "Once, all of the civilized courts in the world wished to trade with our merchants. Now, as the Europeans chart the world, that has begun to change. We cannot allow this, and must contest Eurpean trade in the east if we are to prevent ourselves from falling prey to Europe's deceitful ways."
 mng_modern_economy_desc:0 "Europe has established itself as one of the most culturally, technologically, and militarily powerful regions in the entire world, with some of their Empires spanning the entire globe. If we are to prevent ourselves from becoming prey to European interests, we must advance our economy further and expand on industry and the like."
 mng_formosa_desc:0 "The island of Formosa has been inhabited by barbarians for centuries, and unless we intervene it will remain so. The island is full of resources ripe for the taking, and if we don't take the island ourselves, someone else will."
 mng_amass_army_desc:0 "Our nation is surrounded by enemies on all sides, and if we are to survive this period of turmoil we must expand the army to be able to deal with any threat. After all, the Middle Kingdom has always been a land full of bodies to throw at the wall." 
 mng_defeat_wu_desc:0 "The Wu have been a right thorn in our spine ever since the Red Turban Rebellion began. Now, we have finally triumphed over them, and our coast is secure for the time being."
 mng_red_turbans_desc:0 "As our armies clash with those of the Mongols and their puppets, the Red Turbans hear our calls. With their help, our march to victory has already begun. Down with the Mongols!"
 mng_LOTR_reference_desc:0 "With the Mongol threat dealt with for the time being, we've managed to take control of the Shandong Peninsula and we have complete control of the mouth of the Yellow River, the same River which is home to the cradle of our civilization. As such, the peasants living there feel significantly safer and are able to work without the threat of Mongolian raiders pillaging their homes."
 mng_beijing_desc:0 "With the fall of Peking, any hopes of Mongolian dominance over the Middle Kingdom once again have been extinguished. Now, as we have liberated the Northern Capital, we may overthrow the Mongols and call ourselves the Emperors of China!."
 mng_religious_woes_desc:0 "The Middle Kingdom, with Christian preachers traveling along the Silk Road, has experienced decades of religious turmoil and conflict on a scale unimaginable a few centuries ago. A byproduct of this turbulence is a number of Christian and Pagan states asserting themselves in the west, whom are ripe for the taking and are the gateway to the south."
 mng_silk_road_desc:0 "The Silk Road has, for millennia, been a hub of trade and has resulted in economic prosperity for any who have even slight access to it. Although it is an easy path for Abrahamic preachers to enter the Middle Kingdom, we shoud absolutely take control of one of the main land routes and enjoy the benefits of it."
 mng_rams_desc:0 "Canton, the City of the Rams, is finally under our control. With this, we may begin working our way towards politically and economically dominating the smaller nations in the south and, potentially, expanding our influence into India."
 mng_yunnan_desc:0 "The Yunnan Mountains have always been an obstacle for any invading army, but that has not stopped us. Now that we have conquered the region, it is possible for our reach to extend into the Himalayas and Tibet."
 mng_tibet_desc:0 "Although protected by the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau has seen itself subject to Chinese rule under past dynasties. Tibet has now seen the same fate under our dynasty, and as such the path to the westernmost regions of china is now accessible."
 mng_moghulistan_desc:0 "The remnants of the Mongol tribes have finally been crushed, and as such the silk road is now a much safer place for our merchants. Along with this, our armies have learned that the harsh terrain of the Steppe isn't something to joke about."
 mng_nam_desc:0 "Viet nam, the gateway into Indochina, is now within our grasp. Not only can we begin to dominate the region, but our armies have learned valuable experience from the brutal conditions of the jungles."
 mng_look_east_desc:0 "After the liberation of the Northern Capital the gateway into Manchuria and Mongol has been left open. We should look into conquering these regions, to stamp out the threat of these barbaric raiders crossing into our lands and reversing everything we have accompished."
 mng_manchu_desc:0 "Manchuria is home to the Jurchen tribes, the same ones who have raided the lands of the Middle Kingdom and Joseon for time immemorial. Now that we have conquered the region, these barbaric hordes can begin their transition into civilized life under our guiding hand. More importantly, however, it has opened the gateway into the lands of our Korean friends."
 mng_mongols_desc:0 "The Mongolian hordes, once the proud rulers of all of the Middle Kingdom, have now been crushed under our boot. With their subjugation, the threat of barbaric raiders pillaging our lands is finally gone, and the mistake of the Song Dynasty has been amended."
 mng_joseon_desc:0 "The people of Korea have been subject to constant raids and conquest from Jurchen raiders and Mongolian Khans. Although admirable, this matters little to us."
 mng_japan_desc:0 "The Mongolian Khans tried and failed more than once to subjugate the islands of Japan, and as the true rulers of the Dragon Throne, we have done what they could not and established control over the southernmost islands in the archipelago."
 mng_religious_questions_desc:0 "The Middle Kingdom has been subject to turmoil from Arabahamic preachers and a new faith in the south for decades now. As the old ways begin to falter, we must decide - should we remain following a decadent faith, or should we change our ways if we are to not make the same mistake as the Mongols?"
 mng_affirm_religion_desc:0 "Now that we have decided our faith, we can work to begin mending the schisms in Chinese society and spread our faith to every corner of our growing empire. After all, we are a tolerant society, are we not?"
 mng_religious_unity_desc:0 "The question of religion in the Middle Kingdom has finally been settled, as our faith has emerged triumphant after years of conquest. It is clear now that our faith is to stay, and only another religious disaster could change that."

Either way, it's in our best interest to control the passes."
