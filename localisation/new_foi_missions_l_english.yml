 #Descriptions

 yua_deal_with_ming_desc:0 "The Ming, our largest Chinese subject, are much too rebellious. They believe they stand a chance against us, and constantly vie for independence. We must show them the natural order of things."
 yua_white_lotus_desc:0 "The White Lotus, a heathen monastic order just outside the fringes of our empire, have been allowed to exist for too long. We must wilt the White Lotus."
 yua_wu_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Wu, home of the Wu Chinese people, controls the trade port of Hangzhou as well as much of the coastline around the mouth of the Yangtze River. We must subjugate the Wu to solidify our control over China."
 yua_fujian_desc:0 "Fujian, the region across the Taiwan Strait from the island itself, is rich in tea "
 yua_qaramorin_desc:0 "The Manchus in the east have long been troublesome, raiding our lands and posing a serious threat to our Chinese hegemony. However, we know that diplomacy is not an option; it is time to ensure the Manchus are a thorn in our side no longer, and conquer Qaramörin once and for all."
 yua_liaoyang_desc:0 "The mountains east of Qaramörin are rich with wildlife and ripe for resettlement."
 yua_manchuria_desc:0 "Our ambitions include Korea and the islands of Japan, but before we mount offensives in those lands, we should solidify our control of the land of the Manchus."
 yua_korea_desc:0 "Though the Kings of Goryeo have come and gone, the legacy of Mongol rule in the Korean Peninsula remains. Let us revive the province of Zhengdong and subjugate Korea."
 yua_guangdong_desc:0 "The farmlands in the area surrounding the Pearl River Delta and Gulf of Tonkin are vibrant ecosystems of wildlife and, more importantly, trade. In particular, the city of Xingwang, with its great walled center and strategic positioning, would be particularly valuable to us."
 yua_oirat_desc:0 "The Oirats, though loyal subjects, are in the path of our westward trajectory. We must integrate them."
 yua_chagatai_desc:0 "The Chagatayids rule over a predominantly Christian region, yet call themselves followers of the true Tengri faith. We must conquer their lands and show them how to rule."
 yua_qin_desc:0 "The storied state of Qin and their dynasty of the same name have existed in some configuration for millennia. However, it is now time to extinguish their flame."
 yua_tibet_desc:0 "Tibet, staunchly independent, straddles the border between India, China, and the Central Asian steppes. Its mountainous terrain fosters little habitability, and clusters people and cultures together. All of that aside, it would serve the purpose of a defensible frontier for us."
 yua_kham_desc:0 "The Kham region, like most of Tibet, is mountainous. However, the lands within it are not as inhospitable as the rest of the region. Perhaps we could make something out of it."
 yua_sichuan_desc:0 "Sichuan, ancestral home of the Ba and Shu, is a diverse region of farmlands juxtaposed with mountains and hills. The cities of Chengdu and Chongqing are diamonds in the rough. However, no land can be free from our rule."

 yue_viet_nam_desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors established sovereignty over the area known as Viet Nam by the locals, but to us as Yuènán. The river that flows there, the Hóng Hé, creates rich floodplains ripe for agriculture. We must again secure the Red River Delta."
 yue_tonkin_desc:0 "The central coast of Viet Nam is hilly and full of jungles, and a prime candidate for a regional capital."

 yue_sichuan_basin_desc:0 "The Sichaun Basin and the Chengdu Plain that lies within it are both fertile lands fed by the Upper Yangtze and its tributaries. There is must potential for large settlements in this region."

 #Descriptions

 fra_the_toulouse_question_desc:0 "The split between the French and Toulousian branches of the House of Valois occurred centuries ago, and our two nations have maintained an amicable relationship since. Despite this, there is still a feeling of revanchism in the North, and many call for reunification with the Toulousians. Perhaps we can, er, \"convince\" them to rejoin us."
 fra_aquitaine_desc:0 "The Aquitaine has been contested and valued by many powers over the course of history. All of this, though, is irrelevant; the land is rightfully French."

 #Descriptions
 
 gen_carthago_desc:0 "Using our dominance over the seas near Carthage, we should be able to eke out a majority of influence in the marketplaces of the city itself."
 gen_a_merchant_marine_desc:0 "To be a proper trading power, we must construct a fleet sizable enough to protect our interests, as well as the infrastructure necessary to support such a fleet."
 gen_rival_byz_desc:0 "The Byzantine Navy has a reputation for being an elite, vast sailing force. We must surpass them, and establish a thalassocracy over the Mediterranean."
 gen_crete_desc:0 "The island of Crete lies at the crossroads of Greece, Egypt, the Levant, and the Western Mediterranean; a vital isle indeed. Control of it must be ours."
 gen_tripoli_desc:0 "The city of Tripoli lies on a peninsula jutting into the Mediterranean, and possesses a natural harbor perfect for ship construction. We must seize the city!"
 gen_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria, founded by Alexander of Macedon and famed for its now destroyed library, is a vast city of great importance and has been for centuries. We must capture the city and protect it as a gift for future generations."
 gen_smyrna_desc:0 "In ancient times, Ionia was one of the integral regions of Greece, on par with Attica and the Doric lands. For centuries it has been controlled by the Byzantines. The city of Smyrna, however, is a vital port on the Asia Minor coast, and could serve as a staging point for future invasions and sacks of the Byzantine Empire."
 gen_constantinople_desc:0 "The City of the World's Desire surely fits its nickname, from the Hagia Sophia to the Walls of Justinian. However, like any city, it can be conquered under the right military leadership. For us, it is not a matter of can, but a matter of will!"
 gen_corsica_desc:0 "The island of Corsica lies across the Ligurian Sea from our capital of Zena, and if we do not acquire it, our rivals in Tuscany or Sicilia might!"
 gen_lucca_desc:0 "The many families of Lucca, such as the Malaspinas, Guelphs, and Ghibellines, vie for power against each other and against the merchants. Our interests, however, care not for the petty squabbles of Lucchesi nobles."
 gen_cripple_tnk_desc:0 "The Greek republic of Trinakria controls too many important trading hubs. We must remedy this!"
 gen_pisa_desc:0 "The city of Pisa in times of old was the capital of a mighty maritime republic - not unlike our own. In recent years, however, it has declined in importance, mostly thanks to the Tuscan conquest of the city. We owe it to the people of Pisa to help them reach their former glory! ... under our supervision, of course."
 gen_malta_desc:0 "The small island of Malta possesses its own government dominated by Greeks. Its position, though, is closer to Italy, and thus it ought to be controlled by an Italian power."
 gen_djerba_desc:0 "Gerba, positioned in the Gulf of Gabes, lies in the path of trade moving from Alexandria and the East westward to Spain and Italy. We should capture this small island to serve as a toll station."
 gen_most_powerful_desc:0 "There are many contenders for the products sold at our marketplaces. We must edge out the competition and become dominant."

 #Descriptions
 
 hun_literary_reform_desc:0 "The Hungarian language, while exotic and unique, is nearly impossible to learn without professional training. Using new technology, we can create large volumes of books aimed at those wanting to learn to read a magyar nyelv."
 hun_aus_alliance_desc:0 "The Austrians to the west seek to make Hungary but another one of their realms, through personal union. While this is not to our advantage of course, we may be able to flatter them into an alliance that secures our independence."
 hun_defender_of_faith_desc:0 "Heresy must not be tolerated. Hungary, as the Bulwark of Catholicism, must always stand in defense of the one true Church."
 hun_croatia_desc:0 "The lands of the Croatian Crown once belonged to us, but were seized by the Serbs during their session of empire-building. We must retake Croatia."
 hun_subcarpathia_desc:0 "Over the Carpathian Mountains lies lands of great wealth: Poland, Rus', Ruthenia, and more. As an homage to the Magyar tribes who begat our nation, we should extend our territorial claims to Subcarpathia, and perhaps beyond."
 hun_to_kiev_desc:0 "Kijev, on the Dnyeper, has for centuries been a cultural center of the Rus' people. Conquest of this city would seriously stymie unification of the Rus' people into an entity that could threaten out hegemony."
 hun_dniepr_basin_desc:0 "The Dnyeper Basin has been the stomping grounds for many hordes over the course of history. Dating back to the Huns in Roman times steppe hordes and nomads have called the Dnyeper Basin home. We must make a return to our ancestral lands."
 hun_bulgaria_desc:0 "The Bulgarian people have been under foreign occupation of one kind or another for many years. First the self-proclaimed Roman Empire, and now the Vlachs, who are surely cruel overlords. Liberate them."
 hun_transylvania_desc:0 "The Transylvanian Plateau and the Eastern Carpathian Mountains are controlled by the Vlachs, who have installed a local vassal in an attempt to pacify the Transylvanians. We must show the Vlachs that the whole of Carpathia belongs to us!"
 hun_ottoman_borders_desc:0 "The Byzantines have exerted their influence over the Balkans for too long. We must prepare for war with the so-called Romans!"
 hun_vassal_states_desc:0 "The people of Wallachia cannot possibly survive on their own. Bring them under our protection."
 hun_vassal_states_four_desc:0 "Bosnia, like Serbia, should be in thrall to us, their rightful overlords. A nation as pitiful as this cannot be expected to defend itself against internal revolts, let alone the marauding Greek."
 hun_vassal_states_three_desc:0 "The Serbians have crafted from the disparate lands of the Balkans an empire of their own. Or, at least, they like to think that they are an empire. Bring them into the fold."
 hun_ottoman_borders_desc:0 "It is time we put up a defense against the tide of Anatolian heretics occupying European land. Establish a secure border, and fortify our territory. We shall not surrender easily."

 #Descriptions
 
 tou_bordeaux_desc:0 "In Roman times, the city now known as Bordeaux was the capital of the province of Gallia Aquitania. Today, the city situated on the Gironde is the capital of the rump state of Gascony. We must restore Occitan rule over the city!"
 tou_baleares_desc:0 "Across the Gulf of Lion, south-east of Barcelone, lie four major and many minor islands in an archipelago named the Illas Balearas. A nation in control of these islands could certainly patrol the Western Mediterranean and further their commercial ambitions."
 tou_west_med_islands_desc:0 "The islands of Sardenha and Corsega align more with the cultures of Italy than those of Occitania, but we can change that."
 tou_sicily_desc:0 "Sicily has long been a stronghold for the Greeks. It is time now for all traces of the Graecian settlements to be eliminated."
 tou_france_question_desc:0 "The French branch of the House of Valois still rules in Paris. They are brothers both in language and in blood. This puts us in a unique position, and forces us to make a decision: do we unite the two realms, or continue independently and forge our own, uniquely Toulousian identity?\nThis mission series will expand when this mission is completed."
 tou_arles_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Arles was a Frankish dominion based in Upper Burgundy and the Rhone valley. Its integration into the Holy Roman Empire was a fluke, and as such its status in the Holy Roman Empire must be corrected."
 tou_y_loire_desc:0 "The Loire river rises in the Massif Central and runs north before turning to the west around Orleans. Its basin covers one fifth of the area considered to be French. Control of the Loire would provide the Dual Realms of France and Toulouse with a breadbasket."
 tou_y_normandy_desc:0 "The land of the Normans has been owned by England ever since the Norman invasion of the island. Though the English believe this to mean that the land is theirs rightfully, they forget that the Dukes of Normandie were vassals under the French crown. Let us remind them."
 tou_forts_desc:0 "Our border with the Iberians to the south and southwest is largely unprotected despite the natural defensive frontier of the Pyrenees. We should remedy this."
 tou_catalonia_desc:0 "The Tarraconese to the south share a common ancestry with us. Even their language is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Occitan! We should extend our reach south."
 tou_ligurie_desc:0 "The Italian Riviera is famous for its rich history and cuisine. The port city of Gènoa is the terminus for trade coming from Iberia and the Bay of Biscay, and the republic of the same name exerts its influence over much of the Mediterranean. However, the Republic of Genoa is inherently unstable, and Liguria would be much better off in our hands."
 tou_lombardie_desc:0 "The region of Lombardia in Italy is rich, with fertile floodplains bordering steep mountains. The economic heart of the region is the vast metropolis of Milan. Control of Lombardie, even indirectly, would enrich our nation substantially."
 tou_rights_desc:0 "Toulousian Law, which derives from Visigothic and Roman Law, grants Toulousian women more rights than women in other realms. Though seen by some as weak, we take pride in our sense of equality."

 lus_naval_comms_desc:0 "Since our conquest of Macaronesia, we've been lacking an appropriately sized navy to communicate with the settlers there. We should rectify that."
 lus_exploration_bases_desc:0 "Now that we established appropriate connections between our homeland and our colonies, we should build up one of the islands to have a fair-sized town for a naval base."
 lus_discover_america_desc:0 "It's time we set sail westwards and look for new land, be it islands or an entirely new continent."
 lus_colonial_endeavors_desc:0 "We have successfully discovered a whole new world! We must secure a foothold there for the glory of Lusitania!"
 lus_wood_and_dyes_desc:0 "Down south lies a large jungle with a unique tree with a shade of red in it's trunk. Nod only is the wood of high quality, but it also provides us with a ember-like dye. We shall name it after it's ember-like color - 'Pau-Brasil'."
 lus_inca_desc:0 "Reports indicate a fully settled civilization lives in the mountains on the other side of the New World. Even without horses, they have large roads sprawling through the mountains. And, more importantly, silver. Lots of it. Let's take it all!"
 lus_mastery_of_coins_desc:0 "If we successfully control both the gold from Mexico and silver from Peru, we will have a steady supply of coverage for our currency! We will be able to master inflation and bend markets to our will!"
 lus_foothold_desc:0 "We can initiate operations to take over territories in Africa, much like the Berbers once did in Iberia, if we manage to secure a port."
 lus_northern_morocco_desc:0 "The strait of Gades is too strategically important to not be in our hands. Let us take all of the Mauretanian coast!"
 lus_monopolize_atlantic_desc:0 "The Mauretanians have been tested by us, and they were weak. It's time we remove their access to the coast - we don't need to penetrate inland to penetrate their markets."
 lus_close_mediterranean_desc:0 "Controlling both sides of the Straits of Gades will allow us to block entrance and exit for merchants from other nations!"
 lus_sweet_sugar_desc:0 "The Caraíbas seem to have all of the perfect characteristics to produce sugar in a large scale, even more so than the Macaronesian islands! We must not let this opportunity pass!"
 lus_mexico_desc:0 "The warrior peoples of the so-called 'Mexico' built a massive city in the center of a lake during their breaks from making human sacrifices. It looks pretty, therefore we should take it for ourselves."
 lus_build_up_army_desc:0 "Iberia is a powder keg. We cannot show weakness, let us levy our men and prepare ourselves for an inevitable war that is coming along."
 lus_leon_desc:0 "The lands of the crown of Leão are quite wealthy and will serve to expand our influence in Iberia. It is decidly the next step in our conquests."
 lus_battle_for_badajoz_desc:0 "Badajoz and Hispális have long been a goal for Lusitanian leaders. Their wealth is massive and a good chunk of the money that comes in and out of Iberia comes from there."
 lus_defeat_toledo_desc:0 "Toledo has long been our fiercest rival in Iberia. It's rich port cities rival our own, and their armies are as powerful on land, as our navies are at sea. They have to fall, if we are to prevail."
 lus_crush_cartagena_desc:0 "Cartagena's aggressive and militaristic behavior cannot be tolerated. We must strike before they do to ensure a safe border."
 lus_other_side_desc:0 "Across the peninsula stands Valência, proudly. A large city for those with large ambitions, taking control of it will safeguard the eastern entrepôt of Iberia."
 lus_block_others_desc:0 "At this point, we should just annex the entire northern coast of Iberia to ensure permanent Lusitanian naval supremacy."
 lus_inland_endeavors_desc:0 "We have secured the ports. The inland crowns are deprived of their source of wealth. The time is ripe to push inland."
 lus_central_mountains_desc:0 "At the heart of Iberia, mountains make for a difficult obstacle for conquerors, but we believe we can safely lay siege to these inner territories and become the masters of the mountains ourselves."
 lus_iberia_unification_desc:0 "No one else stands in our way. We rule as the strongest nation in Iberia by far. We shall seal the fate of all those who remain opposing us!"
 lus_olisipo_desc:0 "Olisipo is a respectable city on it's own, but has lacked appropriate effort to expand it's wealth. With some resettling and investing, we will turn it into a metropolis the likes of Paris!"
 lus_vinho_do_porto_desc:0 "The wine from Porto is of the best quality. Perhaps we should invest more into it's production to ensure we have enough to sell to all those willing to buy this delicious drink."
 lus_southern_entrepot_desc:0 "Silves is very strategically positioned. Unfortunately, it's size does not match our expectations, let alone our needs. We must build up infrastructure for it to become the next great center of Iberian wealth."
 lus_aragon_desc:0 "A mountainous duchy that separates us from the western coast, Aragão is yet another barrier for us to overcome."

 asu_defensive_line_desc:0 "The Franks are a threat. They have invaded Iberia once, and we'd be the first to fall if they did again. Let's prepare the best defenses on the continent to resist them."
 asu_preparation_desc:0 "War is coming up. Iberia is heated and our neighbors are like vultures, waiting to prey on our carcass. We must rise up and stand against them."
 asu_lusitania_desc:0 "The Lusitanians think they're so special, ancient Celtiberians ancestry separates them from the Toledans, Cartagenese, and Galicians. Let us remind them that their fragile state is nothing special."
 asu_eradicate_lusitania_desc:0 "The Lusitanians are on the run! With our conquest of Beira, the nobles in Lisbon are quaking in their boots. Or perhaps that's because of the wine... either way, we must eradicate the Lusitanian state and place them under Asturian rule."
 asu_galicia_desc:0 "Galicia, the runt of the Iberian litter, has managed to cling to their existence for centuries. This does not negate the fact that their people are animal and their culture porcine. Let us extend a \"helping hand\" to them."
 asu_central_iberia_desc:0 "The central Iberian plains are rich and fertile. The flat land lends itself well to construction, and there is much possibility for urban centers. We should secure control of central Iberia!"
 asu_andalucia_desc:0 "The south of Iberia is dominated by the mighty kingdom of Toledo. It's vast riches not only stem from the gold mines of La Mancha, but also from the cities of Hispális and Málaga, two of the most important trade nexuses of the Western Mediterranean. The mountains of Málaga may provide a natural barrier to those wanting to invade from the south, but their north is near completely unguarded. Toledo will fall before us!"
 asu_iberian_empire_desc:0 "At last, we have united Iberia! Toledo; Cartagena; Lusitania; Galicia; Navarra; all these realms now fly the yellow cross. Their dynasties are extinct, their people subservient, their lands richer than ever before. Truly, we are Asturias no more. Nay, somos Iberia!"

 cta_return_desc:0 "Our lineage stems from the legacy of the Carthaginian Empire of old. Even our name derives from them! It is time to return to our ancestral homelands."

 cta_gates_desc:0 "With Gibraltar and Northern Mauritania both ours, we should begin the process of utilizing their geographical advantage."

 cta_waters_desc:0 "A formidable navy is a necessity for any rising power, especially one situated on the Mediterranean."
 cta_baleares_desc:0 "The Baleares are a chain of islands off the coast of Tarráco and Valencia. Though they have a long and storied history of independence, they would be better under our control."

 tol_conquer_porto_desc:0 "We have successfully brought much of the Lusitanian wealth under our control, but there is more. We must proceed further and deal with them once and for all."
 tol_islands_desc:0 "These islands across the Atlantic are much bigger and more productive than Macaronesia. Perhaps the distance is worth covering for the sugar monopoly."

 #Descriptions

 tou_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "Toulouse is at a crossroad of history. In the north, France slips into Chaos, in the south the Iberian princes are still recovering from the Imwehhedian invasion, the Byzantine influence over the western Mediterranean is finally faded, and in the East the Power of the German emperor diminishes, while the Italian princedoms and city states are acting increasingly independent. The time is nigh, when Toulouse shall take it's place at the world stage. All we need, is a strong Army and Navy."
 tou_fall_of_gascony_desc:0 "The Gascony is the last part of Aquitaine, which isn't Part of our Kingdom. If we want to make use of all our titles, claims and treaties, we first have to unite our ancestral homeland. But this isn't going to be easy, as the Dukes of Gascony are proud, and not to yield easily. They could even call upon their British or Iberian relatives. To prevent this, we should name a noble as margrave. With this our western flank would be guarded from attacks by sea or from the Basque Country, and we could peruse a push into Eastern Iberia, without fear from an attack in the rear."
 tou_carolus_legacy_desc:0 "Long ago, Charles the Great, Charlemagne, Roman Emperor, King of the Franks, and ruler over both Aquitaine and Occitania, to invade Iberia and the remnants of the Visigoth empire. In the end, the chaos of the small Iberian Kingdoms proved too hard to handle even for him, but he still managed to capture northern Iberia. We shall do the same. The Terraconesians in the South share a common ancestry with us, and even their language is often called a dialect of Occitanian! We shall integrate them into our Realm. This would open Iberia to us."
 tou_rolands_revenge_desc:0 "Nearly 500 years ago, the invasion of Charlemagne ended in the chaos of the Iberian minors, and he tasked the noble Hruotland, or Roland, the cover the retreat of the Frankish army. But when they had nearly reached the border of Charlemagne's empire, they were ambushed by the traitorous Basques. At the pass of Roncevaux Roland fell in a heroic last stand. Even though Roland was a Breton by birth, and a Frank by law, his grave in Blaye, Rocamadour, where his legendary sword Durendal is lodged in a cliff, and Bordeaux where his famous horn Olifant is supposedly hidden, are popular pilgrimage sites, and he is one of our most loved heroes. We owe it to him, to exact revenge on the Basques in his name."
 tou_mediterranean_foothold_desc:0 "Since the Byzantine lost control over the Balearics, many western nations tried to claim the isles for themselves, but all failed on the determination of the Grooks. We think our chances to succeed are slightly better, if we just can muster enough troops, to flood those island with them. We should build more ships for their transport."
 tou_sardaigne_toulousaine_desc:0 "Now we have a foothold in the Mediterranean, we should put more pressure on those trade routes. Control over the Tyrrhenian sea is only possible, by taking control over Sardinia as well, for without it, a domination of the trade is impossible. If we menage that, our focus should lay on Sicily and Malta, so all trade from eastern to western Mediterranean has to go through us."
 tou_blokade_the_east_desc:0 "Since our invasion of Sardinia, and after it became known that me claim Malta and Sicily for ourselves, we received multiple threats from the Byzantine court. They claim protectorate over all Greek Christians in the Mediterranean, but we all know, that they just fear the loss of influence over the western trade, and Magna Grecia. We should make it clear to them, what it means, to start a trade war with us."
 tou_french_religioious_piety_desc:0 "Occitania was always a deeply spiritual country, even when our faith was... unorthodox. Even though many pledge their lives to mother church, and to support them, we should build new churches, so they stay strong in their faith."
 tou_a_question_of_faith_desc:0 "For some time now, there is a new faith spreading. Man who wander around, nailing their theses on church portals, and proclaim the separation from the Pope. How to deal with this development is subject of much discussion. Should be stay strong in our old faith, take up the new ways, or, how some suggest, even give the old Catharian teachings a new chance..."
 tou_we_know_the_way_desc:0 "After many years of unrest and uncertainty our country is reborn out of the fires of the Reformation, and now it is fixed which religion we shall follow. It is time, for a new age, so we will spread our faith into the farthest reaches of our realm. We should claim protectorate over all our brothers in faith, and proclaim the true faith for all the world to see."
 tou_a_maritime_power_desc:0 "In the last decades our country grew from a rather minor power, in between powerful neighbors, into a major player on the world stage, who can compete with the Iberians, the British or Germans. But our new power has also brought us in conflict with the Byzantines, the strongest empire in the east, who are especially jealous of our trade dominance in the western Mediterranean. Now, we leave the chaos of the Reformation behind us, it is time to finally become the Mediterraneans dominant power. For this purpose we will gather a large army, to subjugate the petty remnants of the crusader states along the Barbarie coast."
 tou_no_hre_allowed_desc:0 "For Centuries we have been bitter rivals of the Holy Roman Empire. Which makes the emperors ambition, to reestablish his power over the remnants of the kingdom of Arles, espescially the duchy of Dauphine, that more worrying. That would mean a direct border with an empire-controlled Savoy, with no natural defenses along it. That must not happen! We should use the fact, that our friend in Dauphine don't appreciate the emperors meddling in their affairs either, and propose a defensive pact. That would mean one less worry."
 tou_fate_of_avignon_desc:0 "In the times of the crusades, our king back then leased the bishopric of Avignon to the Holy See. The city should serve as an observation post, so the crusaders, setting sail from the southern French ports to the Barbarie, would respect the rules of hospitality, and not start plundering and killing while still in Europe. The pope also wanted to keep an eye on the growing Cathar movement, in their Pyrenean mountain forts. Both Crusades and Cathars are long gone, and it is time to reclaim our property. To assure success, we should first improve relations with the Papal State."
 tou_mourne_for_arles_desc:0 "Historical, dynastic and politic connections allow us to claim Dauphine and Avignon, but it isn't that easy with the rest of the kingdom of Arles, today part of the duchy of Provence. The Region changed Hands to often, to let any claims stick. But there are two very good reasons, why we have to claim this land: On one had, would control over Rhône-valley and the southern Alps assure our eastern border, and make an attack from this direction nearly impossible, and on the other hand, we would gain access to the riches of Liguria and Piedmont."
 tou_southern_french_trade_desc:0 "Piedmont and Liguria are two of the richest regions in Europe. Genoa is the final destination of most trade from the known world, and in the hills of Piedmont the wine flows as plentiful as vegetable, fruit and grain do in the flood plains of the Po-valley. The surplus from this Region will support an extension of our trade network, and will be the reserves for future expansions. Control over this two regions will make us into a trade and export power - and maybe even a great power."
 tou_beyond_the_sea_desc:0 "From Lusitania we hear strange whispers of vast lands beyond the sea, ripe for the taking. Some of our counties warn, that such hearsay must not divert attention away from our European problems, but we are still intrigued. A short while ago two men from northern France - Jacques Cartier and Jean Ribault - contacted us, as they are eager to explore this new world, but have been denied by Paris. We shouldn't share our northern neighbors foolishness, and finance their expeditions."
 tou_french_colonial_foothold_desc:0 "Now, that we have established ourselves in the new world, we should try to strengthen our influence there. If we divert more resources towards this endeavor, in the end we surely can build a great colonial empire, worthy of our proud nation. To hesitate now, would be fatal. We still have one up on our competitors, which we must nor waste. We also should not be as foolish as our Iberian friends, and seek to annihilate the natives. Instead we should integrate them peacefully in our empire. Their knowledge on this country and it's riches is too valuable to go to wast."
 tou_french_colonial_breakthrough_desc:0 "We pushed far into the North American interior, and it is beginning to drain our resources. Our Colonial Governors propose, that we limit our expansion to the area around the great rivers, the St Lawrence and the Mississippi. This seems reasonable, especially because some of our native American friends talk of a connection between both rivers high up in the northwest. Even if that should prove false, they may come close enough together, so that transport by land is a viable option."
 tou_a_womans_work_desc:0 "The Queen always had a special place in the governance of our country, but that is especially true, since Joan of Toulouse proved, that a woman is an as capable ruler as a man. Since than we had a number of Queens, who excelled at court and the field of battle. Let us keep up this tradition, and in future have even more female advisors at court."
 tou_the_queensguard_desc:0 "The Queensguard is an elite unit of mercenaries, who guards the reigning queen of Toulouse, no matter if regent herself or just princess consort, and is only loyal to her. We should use their experience to reform our army and navy."
 tou_in_the_queens_name_desc:0 "Our people's loyalty to their fatherland is only surpassed by their love and devotion for their queen, symbol of the nation as a whole. Many a man is ready to go to war in the queen's name, and even accept decreased pay when time are hard. This allows us to muster a greater army than most."
 tou_a_path_to_enlightenment_desc:0 "To oppress our people like many European rulers do, is repulsive to us. No - in Toulouse the people and crown are a sworn unity. The path to enlightenment does not lead over the broken backs of the people, but is made of justice and unity."
 tou_kingdom_of_enlightenment_desc:0 "The ideas of the enlightenment quickly found many supporters in our country. We should invite the brightest minds in our realm to our court, and found new universities, to found a true kingdom of enlightenment."
 tou_a_unique_empire_desc:0 "Oh glorious Toulouse. Unique empire, loving it's people and loved by it. May you survive many ages, and uphold the ideals of humanism and enlightenment, to spite all doubters and unbelievers. - Voltaire"
 tou_integrate_the_spanish_march_desc:0 "The long term ambitions of the Imperial Carolingian dynasty were to integrate the former Visigothic rump states into the restored Western Roman Empire of the Franks. Despite this dream never being fully realized, our monarchs have been able to bring the lands of the former Iberian March back into our political sphere of influence. We must continue the ambitions of our ancestors by finally integrating the former lands, of the Iberian March, into our kingdom once and for all."

 #Descriptions

 ctg_form_alliances_desc:0 "Many Decades have passed since the crusades, and our country looses more and more of it's influence. For now we still are the strongest of the old crusader states, and if we don't pay attention, one of our rivals will surpass us. We have to restore the old balance of power, but we hardly can't do that alone. We need reliable allies on our way towards regional dominance. We should aspire an alliance with the Pope, and one of the lesser crusader states. Agadir or the Knights Templar would be dependable partners. If we can build up a strong army too, there will stand nothing in our way."
 ctg_subjugate_tripolitania_desc:0 "If we once shall fulfill our old mission, to guide the Barbarie back onto the right path, we have to secure ourselves against interference. This danger is greatest form the east. Both the Byzantines, and whoever controls Egypt, could try to use Cyrenaica to gain influence in our country. But if we handle this well, we can get rid of two problems here. We can use Tripolitanias old obligations towards us, to integrate them into our country as a march. This will be a buffer against incursions from the east, and also disperse all illusions Tripoli has on their own importance."
 ctg_conquer_fezzan_desc:0 "With Tripoli under our direct control, we have to clean up our own backyard. The conquest of Malta and Fezzan shall be our next goal. Who controls Malta, controls all traffic in the Mediterranean, which will make it impossible for our enemies to attack us by sea. Fezzan on the other hand, may be part of the catholic sphere, but you shouldn't trust the desert Berbers. They could decide, that an alliance with their heretic brothers may be better for them. Nevertheless, we should give back the coastal provinces of Fezzan to Tripolitania, if they serve us well, for it was part of their realm once."
 ctg_subjugate_kabylia_desc:0 "Now the east is finally secured, we should turn towards Kabylia. The Region is the only place, that still can threaten our capital. But she also has a lot of potential. We should integrate Kabylia too as a march. The realm will provide the military advantage, we need to finally move against the Tadmunite plague. Some of Kabylia and Fezzan still follow this foolishness too, and that has to end. It is our highest duty as the catholic authority of the region, to reinstate order. Garamantia shall be our next goal!"
 ctg_dominate_region_desc:0 "The desert bleeds. The Tadmunite traitors in Garamantia suppress their people, raid our country, and break every treaty you make with them. They have to be destroyed, and the people guided back to the true faith. An attack on their country will be complicated, for the desert is unforgiving, but our lessons in Fezzan prepared us for exactly that. If Garamantia is pacified, nothing will stand in our way of becoming the strongest power in the Barbarie, and beyond. Maybe we can make a visit to the kingdom of Numidia too. The catholic way, is the only way for the Barbarie!"

 mau_religious_peace_desc:0 "Our land is divided. In the Northwest along the coast, the Catholics gather under the banner of the city of Walila, and a revolt seems unavoidable. In the Southwest the Tadmunites in the Mountains would very much like to join their brothers in the south, and prefer the old tribal ways. The crown has long tried, to balance those two extremes, but it seems we have to decide, if we should should still follow the words of Tadmun, or convert and join the Catholics? We should also search for an Iberian ally, for they pose the biggest threat to our country, but the question remains, if the name of that ally shall really be Gades..."
 mau_secure_south_desc:0 "Beyond the Atlas lie the dukedoms of Sus and Tafilalt. For a long time, their tribes have far too much influence in our country, a situation, that can not go on unchecked. A modern Nation should not make itself reliant on family bonds with their neighbors. The integration of south Mauritania would strengthen our position by a lot, and make every attack from the south fruitless, as the desert is unforgiving. If we strengthen our army and navy, and build many modern heavy ships, we can cut all supplies to the desert, and make the invasion of Sus and Tafilalt quicker and less bloody. It will also give us new access to the resources of the Agisymba."
 mau_assert_regional_dominance_desc:0 "East of us, the kingdom of Numidia, the Dukedom of Agadir and the Templar stronghold pose a substantial threat to our realm. Should they try to ally the Iberians, they could encircle us. This cannot happen! We have to quickly conquer both the Mitidian coast and the highlands. If we can do that, we can final secure our country once and for all, and we are elevated to a regional power. Even an attack against the Iberians or Timbuktu could be possible than."
 mau_spread_influence_desc:0 "Not far from our coast, lay the islands of the Azores, the Canaries and the island of Madeira. That wouldn't normally bother us, but in a modern world, it would be too easy to use them to block all our trade. We have to make sure, that this will not happen. But if we achieve this with by allying Lusitania, the strongest maritime Power, or by conquering the islands, we shall see. Nevertheless, we should build up our navy, to protect our trade fleet."
 mau_secure_bridgehead_desc:0 "Not so long ago, our ancestors crossed the strait of Gades under the Imwehhd banner, and tried to conquer Iberia in the name of their faith. Even if the wars of religion are long a thing of the past, the riches of Hispális, Córdoba and Málaga are still too compelling. But we have to assure ourselves, and built the most modern forts of our time in La Roca and Ceuta. If we can secure a bridgehead, we will have the whole of Iberia in our hands."

 crusader_form_alliances_desc:0 "After the chaos of the crusades, many small kingdoms and dukedoms remained along the coastline, which are often called crusader states, even if some of them like Kabylia are more a Berber nation, or like Walila are de facto still under Tadmunite control. They all wrestle for control of the coast, a position at the moment filled by the kingdom of Carthago. Now a new era is dawning, and we shall not fall behind. For this purpose, we should ally one of the rising Iberian Nations, as well as gaining the favor of the Pope. That should strengthen our position enough, that we can openly attack our crusader rivals."
 crusader_dominance_desc:0 "Finally it is time. We are no longer one crusader state under many, but a force to be reckoned with. Just a little more, and we can overtake Carthago. For that, we have to a least take two of the traditional centers of the crusaders, and surpass Carthago in martial and economic might. This will show or rivals, that we are ready to take the lead of the catholic states of the Barbarie. Our goal may seem ambitious, but the peoples of the Barbarie are known for their resilience and their unshakable will. Nobody will stand in our way."
 crusader_overthrow_carthago_desc:0 "The age of Carthagos is over at last. That at least is clear. But those fools still hold onto their old claims. It is time, that like the Romans so many hundreds of years ago, we march against Carthago, and integrate their realm into ours. But to destroy her too, would be a bit too much... She will be our new bastion in future wars against the other crusader states. Though before we can do that, we should take a moment, to fully integrate the new lands in our country, raise our reputation with the people."
 crusader_dominate_barbarie_desc:0 "With the end of Carthago, we are finally in the position to make ourselves the foremost power in the Barbarie. All the other crusader nations still will try to defy us, but that's nothing we have to fear anymore. We are already powerful enough, to nip all resistance in the bud. The dominance of the coast will provide many new opportunities, like for example the continuation of the crusade against the Tadmunites in the hinterland, or even an expedition into the new lands beyond the sea..."
 crusader_carribean_influence_desc:0 "Now the coast is under our lone control, and we did away with all our crusader rivals, be can finally deal with the Berbers in the hinterlands. This war will cost us great sums of gold though, the lands of the Barbarie simply cannot provide. But we have another strategy, how we can improve our financial situation: Our fist expeditions into the Caribbean have reviled, that the region is greatly suited for growing all kinds of luxurious goods for export. Especially some of the eastern islands seem to be promising. We should establish a partly autonomous colonial administration, to monitor this endeavor, and secure our claims, while we wage war at home."

Only the Berber countries of Numidia and Fezzan are free of crusader influence, and still follow the true faith. If we want to convert our brothers back to the true faith, we have to on one hand make sure, that our supply lines are secured, by securing access to the sea, and on the other hand, by forming alliances with other catholic countries. With their help, and the supplies, they will send by the new ports, we will be able to strengthen our army and our defenses, and do away with the Tadmunite plague!"

For this purpose, we have to raise our reputation with the people. The best way to achieve this, is to flush out the last pockets of heresy in our borders, and with this secure the favor of the Pope. Only then we can begin to unite the Territories of the eastern Berbers. The infidels in Garamantia shall be our next target then."
 cathber_unite_the_eastern_berbers_desc:0 "We are only strong together! - this faith is deeply rooted in our culture. The members of the tribes and families have always stuck together. It is time, that we elevate this mentality onto state level, and begin to unite the Berber peoples of the Barbarie. To unite the eastern catholic Berbers of Fezzan and Numidia, has to be our main and foremost goal. For this purpose we have to liberate Garamantia form the tadmunite yoke. It will be the first step on our way to turn all Berbers to the true faith."

 arm_break_the_chains_desc:0 "Since the Armenian partition, during the Kurdish domination in the 12th century, and the Mongol invasions of Europe during the 13th, the people of Armenia have been under constant foreign control. They shattered our country into many small pieces, and divided us. The west - the kingdom of Malatya - bowed to Byzantine sovereignty, in the attempt to conserve some of their independence, is now under the control of the rouge Greek breakaway state of Ikonion. The east - the duchy of Karabakh - first entered Kurdish control by treason, and continued to serve as vassals under the different Mongol states and their successors. And finally the central realm of Vaspurakan, fought a fruitless war of defense, and was finally overthrown, first by the Kurds, and than by the Mongols. It is time for Armenia to rise up in revolt, and shake off the yoke of their oppressors."
 arm_western_armenia_desc:0 "Western Armenia is threatened. Ikonion - a renegade Byzantine breakaway state - took over, with it's secession from Constantinople, the Kingdom of Malatya, last nation state of the Western Armenians, and are now exercise a ruthless strategy of cultural assimilation. Cilicia, once thriving center of Western Armenian culture, is nearly fully grecofied, and if we don't interfere, the rest of the country will soon follow."
 arm_reclaim_cicilia_desc:0 "Cilicia was once the thriving center of Western Armenian culture. Our conquest of the western lands, makes it possible, to return the region to the Armenians. As soon as this is done, and the Miaphysite believe has replaced the Greek heresy, we can start, to give back to the people their Armenian heritage."
 arm_fortify_greek_border_desc:0 "As the crimes of the Ikonions prove, the Greeks can never be trusted again, no matter if they are the Byzantines, Ikonions, or Nicaeans. We must build a strong line of defense along the western border, so that the port cities of Cilicia and with them our access to the sea may be protected."
 arm_egyptian_alliance_desc:0 "Egypt was and is the closet friend of Armenia. We are not only connected by the believe in the Miaphysite teachings, but we share a history of mutual aid and suffering. We both won our independence in the Miaphysite rebellion against Byzantium, and suffered in similar fashion under the Kurdish and Mongol Invasion. We shall deepen this bond even more - if possible also by dynastic connections."
 arm_restore_central_armenia_desc:0 "Vaspurakan was once the only Armenian nation state, who sought the hopeless fight against the Kurds and Mongols. This heroic attempt to keep Armenian independence alive, only led to these savages taking the whole region. It is time, that Central Armenia will once again be led by Armenians. Only then, there will be a future for our country."
 arm_destroy_upper_kurdistan_desc:0 "At the dawn of the 12th century, Armenia was one of the strongest powers on the silk road, controlling a territory stretching from Eastern Anatolia to the Caucasus and Northern Persia. But in only a few years, Armenian hegemony in the region was thoroughly crushed. A small principality, which had long been an Armenian protectorate, grew under the leadership of their young ruler, the ingenious General Selahedînê Eyûbî in a very short time, into a great power, that would crush the armies of Egypt, Persia and Greece. Armenia to wasn't spared from Selahedînê Eyûbî's ambitions. After the consolidation of the Kurdish tribes, and his conquest of Syria, he turned north, and toward Armenia. He triumphed in one battle against the Armenian armies after the other, and finally managed to take the old capital of Ani. There he slaughtered the old royal family, and demanded all Kurdish areas, the lands around lake Urmia, and the partition of Armenia into small states - all tributary to him alone. Shortly after, during this first campaign against Egypt, a last coalition of Armenian nobles rebelled against him, and only the through the treachery of the lords of Karabakh, allowed him to triumph again. We shall make the Kurds pay, for Selahedînê Eyûbî's sins."
 arm_eliminate_mongol_threat_desc:0 "South of our lands, in the deserts of northern Syria and Mesopotamia, the sorry remnants of the Jalayirids - last holdover of the mongols in the Middle East - are just barely clinging on. The days of oppression of the whole of Armenia by the Mogol khans, are long gone, but you should never underestimate a Mongol. Never could have ever predicted the rise of Genghis Khan, who conquered half of the world. We should stomp out the last embers of the Ilkhanate, to nip any danger in the bud, and take the rich coastal cities of Syria and the patriarchal city of Antiochia for ourselves."
 arm_liberate_damaskus_desc:0 "Deep to the south, lies Damascus, undisputed center of southern Syria - also called the Lebanon. If we can liberate the country of the Monothelite heresy, we not only gained access to the resources of the Middle Eastern coast, but we also to the Holy Land, that has been reigned by misguided individuals for far too long."
 arm_eastern_armenia_desc:0 "Many years ago, the first Lords of Eastern Armenia, the Duchy of Karabakh, committed terrible treason against all Armenians. They sold their brothers in arms to the Kurdish lord Selahedînê Eyûbî - and again later to the Mongols - in exchange of some power for themselves. Now we have the responsibility, to right their wrongs, heal the old wounds, and integrate Eastern Armenia back into the country."
 arm_reclaim_georiga_desc:0 "Before the partition of Armenia, Georgia was a tributary to the Armenian kings in Ani. To keep our home country, and the passes over the Caucasus mountains secure against the raids of the steppe tribes, ist is our duty to restore this situation. Only if Georgia is firmly in our hands, the northern border will be safe."
 arm_repay_the_qq_desc:0 "The Qara Qoyunlu - heirs to the mongol rule in eastern Anatolia - may only be the last in a long line of the oppressors of Armenia, but we will make sure, that they will be the last. We should strike, now that their grip on the region is nearly fully broken, and take their power base around Tabriz. This should stop the Azerbaijani threat once and for all."
 arm_avange_the_partition_desc:0 "Our success against northern Kurdistan was only the beginning of our revenge for the crimes of Selahedînê Eyûbî's. The southern Kurds will be next, who will experience our righteous wrath over the partition of Armenia. We neither can't allow the Yazidi heresy to spread beyond the borders of Kurdistan. We must guide them back onto the true path. If we can do that, the gate to the south will be open to us. Whoever controls the Zagros and Luristan, controls Persia."
 arm_incursion_into_persia_desc:0 "The biggest threat for Armenia was always coming out of Persia. Whether the Sassanids, Mongols or the Turkmen tribes, nearly everything bad for Armenia came from the east. Now that we finally defeated the Qara Qoyunlu, the next threat is coming our way: Some of the Azerbaijani warlords, who fled form our attack, have found shelter with their relatives in northern Persia, and now try to convince the Shah to attack us. We should strike first, and teach the Shah a lesson. The new Armenia should not be messed with."

 hsn_unite_kurds_desc:0 "Many years now, the Eyûbîd dynasty has been split into three branches, and with it, the whole Kurdistani region.\nFrom the city of Nineveh, the most senior branch governs the shattered satrapy of Bohtan, a former Mongol vassal, tasked by the Ilkhans to guard the eastern border of Mesopotamia, who, under the influence of their overlords, abandoned their Yazidi heritage, in favor of Nestorian Christianity.\nExactly this fact led to the split with the southern branch of the Eyûbî dynasty, based in the province of Ardalan, who prides itself in their upholding of the Yazidi traditions and is loosely supported by Persia, in an attempt to regain control of the region.\nThe last and most junior branch, is based in the city of Bitilis, and recently adopted the Armenian Miaphysite church, due to a sizable minority of it's subjects being of Armenian descent. They tried to gain support from the Qara Qoyunlu in their quest for self determination, but after some initial gains, the Azerbaijani struck a backhand deal with Soran, and so Bitilis was subjegated again.\nA confrontation between the branches of the Eyûbîds seem inevitable, and only the one, who can amass enough support and manpower, will emerge victorious."
 rush_the_levant_hsn_desc:0 "The lands of the Middle East are of great symbolical importance for the Eyûbîd Dynasty, because it is here, that our great ancestor Selahedînê learned his martial skills, gained his name, and finally led our country to many victories. Selahedînê spent most of his youth as a mercenary for the Ghassanid kings of upper Arabia, and for his service, he was awarded the title 'Selahedînê' - Saladin - meaning, 'righteousness of the faith' for he never wavered in his Yazidi beliefs.\nLater on in his life, he used the same lands, he spent his youth in, as a gateway right into Egypt. If we can mirror his fast advance in the region, we too shall be able to subdue Egypt."
 conquer_armenia_hsn_desc:0 "At the dawn of the 12th century, Armenia was one of the strongest powers on the silk road, controlling a territory stretching from Eastern Anatolia to the Kaukasus and Northern Persia. But in only a few years, Armenian hegemony in the region was thoroughly crushed. The small principality of Kurdistan arose as a major power under the leadership of the great Selahedînê Eyûbî and split up the Armenian realm. We shall do as he did, and swiftly conquer central Armenia, for it will provide us with access to the whole north."
 subjegate_georgia_hsn_desc:0 "When Selahedînê prepared his for his advance into Armenia, he had the support of the Georgian principalities, also subject to Armenian rule, and more than eager to end it. They are formidable soldiers, and we too should not abstain from having them in our ranks. We should try to approach them as friends first, but subjugate any of them, who are not willing to submit to our rule or follow a different master."
 conquer_north_meso_hsn_desc:0 "The region known as Babylon, is one of the richest in the whole known world. Selahedînê swiftly conquered it so many years ago, and now it shall become the crown jewel of our realm. The time of Mongol rule is over, and the time of the Empire of the Kurds has returned."
 conquer_south_meso_hsn_desc:0 "The southern part of Mesopotamia, since antiquity has been known as Maishan, is today ruled by Beth Nahrain, a semi autonomous breakaway state of the Jalayirid realm. The delta region of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is key to gaining access to the maritime part of the silk road, a feature, our nation could never before exploit. Now times have changed, and with a new age dawning, the possibilities for our countries future are endless - if we manage to subdue the region."
 kurd_religion_yazidi_1_desc:0 "Kurdistan is torn by a religious conflict, that effects all aspects of life. We have to end the religious divide once and for all, and show all our subjects the true path. But while our country has many capable generals and statesmen, we lack an expert on religious matters, who can sway the masses. Time to employ someone like this."
 kurd_religion_yazidi_2_threat_desc:0 "In the last years, our efforts in establishing the Yazidi beliefs as the sole faith in our country, have been very successful, but in the one region, it matters the most, we could gain the least amount of ground. Kurdistan itself is still religiously extremely divided. A grievance, we shall rectify with haste."

 #Descriptions

 bos_one_true_faith_desc:0 "For a long time Bosnia has been caught between the East and West, between the Latin and the byzantine churches, who again and again split and parted our country. This is the reason, why you can find both of those religions in Bosnia. Also have those Bosniens, who grew tired of the constant interference founded their own church, influenced by the teachings of Bogomil. It is time, that our country and people are united in faith, but this won't be possible without political unification first. Bosnia finally has to be united. When this is done, we can work on ridding the remaining Balkan of heresy too."
 bos_conquer_zara_desc:0 "Northern Dalmatia, and especially the Duchy of Zara, have suffered far too long under Venetian rule. The Dalmatians may not be fellow Slavs, but after hundreds of years of being neighbors, they are still close to us. It is our duty, to liberate, and integrate them into our country."
 bos_conquer_carniola_desc:0 "Carniola, the Germans call it 'Krain', is both the gate to Western Europe and Italy. Though most of it's inhabitants are Slovene, Carniola has never seen a Slovene state. It is time, that we show the people a Slavic ruler, or they will maybe even turn into Germans in the end. And if we are already there, we could maybe check out the Alps and the upper Danube. I heard they are lovely..."
 bos_conquer_the_citystates_desc:0 "The republican Cities of Ragusa and Cattaro, are thriving centers of trade of the Adriatic Coast, and many goods from East and West can be found at their markets. It is high time, that we get our share of this wealth. Democracy is highly overrated form of governance anyway."
 bos_conquer_albania_desc:0 "Are Arberians Greeks or Slavs? Why should we bother. The strategic value of this mountainous country is too great, that we could let such a question influence us. Only if we hold Arberia, we have a chance, to withstand the superior Byzantine might, and extend our influence to southern Greece. We can also use the Arberian coast as a bridge into southern Italy."
 bos_conquer_slavonia_desc:0 "Slavonia has changed hands nearly as often as Bosnia. Ans so it is no wonder, that here too, the Bosnian Church can be found. Both Bulgarians and Croatians had their chance, to establish their claim on the region once and for all, but now it is our turn, and we will succeed, where they failed."
 bos_conquer_croatia_desc:0 "No other country tried conquering Bosnia as often as Croatia. With the might of the Holy Roman Empire behind it, the Grand Duchy of Zagreb feels untouchable, by we will turn the tables, and this time it will be Croatia, who falls under Bosnian control. Oh what joy it will be, to for one show the the other side of the coin. And when Croatia has fallen, the Venetians and the other north Italians will be next. Those how used every opportunity to exploit our economic or military weaknesses."
 bos_conquer_belgrade_desc:0 "The white city of Belgrade, sits as an outpost of the Byznatines in the middle of the Balkan. It is the greatest irony, that the Serbs, who hail themselves the mightiest of the southern Slavs, and destined to rule then, are the most dependent on the aid of foreign nations. We sill have a debt to settle with them, for the help they provided to the orthodox rebels of Herzegowina. It is time that we pay the white city a visit. And who knows, if we like it there, we will keep it."
 bos_conquer_montenegro_desc:0 "Of all the counties of the Balkans depenend on foreign aid, Montenegro is probably the most pathetic. An orthodox country, on the border to the Byzantines, ruled by a catholic monarch, who only got his title by the grace of the German emperor and his bohemian armies. It is time, that we rid the world of this absurdity. Then nothing will remain in our way of spreading Bosnian influence to northern Greece and Moesia."

 #Descriptions

 ser_befriend_grikos_desc:0 "Since the Serbian tribes were pushed from Macedonia into the north, we hadn't had any access to the sea, and it's trade. We need someone to guide us, and show us all the wrinkles of maritime trade. The Grikos, brothers in the Orthodox faith, and masters of trade will surely help us."
 defy_the_emperor_desc:0 "The German Empire has always treated the Balkan as a sort of Colony at best and a battlefield at worst in it's quest to wipe out the Orthodox church. The Serbian and Bosnian people always bore most of this load, but especially after the treacherous and cowardly Croats bowed their head to the so called emperor. It is time that we strengthen our country and gather allies, to push the Germans from the Balkan once and for all."
 ser_fate_of_slovenes_orth_desc:0 "It seems like our efforts to oppose them at every turn have been noticed in the empire, as the emperor is fortifying the duchies along the border to our lands. Especially Carniola, how the Germans call the land of our Slovene brothers is of great strategic value to the empire and if it were to fall in our hand, will enable us to end the emperors ambitions in the Balkan once and for all."
 ser_befriend_italians_desc:0 "Since the Serbian tribes were pushed from Macedonia into the north, we hadn't had any access to the sea, and it's trade. We need someone to guide us, and show us all the wrinkles of maritime trade. The Latin Italians, brothers in the Catholic faith, and masters of trade will surely help us."
 join_the_empire_desc:0 "The German Empire has always tried to establish peace in the Balkan, that has for far to long been dominated by heresy, as well as unjust and illegitimate tyrants. The Serbian and Bosnian people always bore most of this load, but especially after the lucky Croats were allowed to join the empire and finally achieved some peace. It is time that we strengthen ties to the empire, and muster all our resources, so that we may be deemed worthy to join the empire as well."
 ser_fate_of_slovenes_cath_desc:0 "It seems like our efforts to help the emperor in his strive to liberate the Balkan have not gone unnoticed, and we are hailed as the new great protectors of true Christendom in the empire. Even if we think, that we could do more, we are already stretchered to the limit. As our powerbase is under constant threat of invasion from the south, we need somewhere to safe to plan a response from, should the worst happen. Especially Carniola, how the Germans call the land of our Slovene brothers would be of great strategic value us, and if it were awarded to us by the emperor, it shall enable us to finally let the emperor's vision for Balkan come to pass."
 ser_reform_army_desc:0 "Serbia is strong, but to reestablish our power in the region, we must first rebuild our military might. Reinforcing our army, derelict for so long, will go a long way towards revitalizing our standing in the region."
 ser_deal_with_bosnia_desc:0 "Bosnia is a... confusing land. Its people succumb to old heresies, like Bogomilism, and its leaders refuse to be in communion with our faith. Bosnia needs guidance, and we need to be the ones who guide it."
 ser_demand_eastern_serbia_desc:0 "Eastern Serbia has always been outside of the control of Belgrade or Montenegro. In 1404, a joint diplomatic effort of both duchies, produced a treaty with the Cumans, that guaranteed a special status for Eastern Serbia within Cuman law. Also included was a provision, that stated, should the Serbian duchies ever unite, a renegotiation of the treaty would be needed. This should give the Cuman ruler influence over the newly formed Pan-Serbian nation. We are confident, that this influence and a few other concessions of ours will be worth Eastern Serbia as a whole, as well as plant the seeds of our own ambitions in the Cuman court."
 ser_pacify_cumania_desc:0 "While Cumania has in the past often been an ally to the Serbian Duchies, so it is also true, that some of their past rulers desired to extend their domain to the Serbian borderlands. If they were another Slavic people, we may could look past this, but seeing as they were born from a Tartar horde, and adopted a civilized lifestyle merely centuries ago, many fear, they could return to their roots. So it was decided, we shall take stewardship of their realm, until they are truly ready to join the civilized nations."
 ser_fate_of_the_dacian_desc:0 "Dacia, sometimes called the easternmost truly roman province, has been in disarray for many centuries now. The Slavic migration, the Bulgar invasion, the Tartar storm - all these changes in eastern Europe have separated the three Dacian duchies of Moldova, Wallachia and Transylvania from the rest of the Latin world, but also from the Byzantine influence. The Dacian people yearn for stability, and we think we can provide that. We may not be as strong as the Roman empire... yet - but we will do our best, to secure peace in Dacia."
 ser_gain_dalmatian_ports_desc:0 "Not all of our rivals are so close by that we can march our armies over land and defeat them that way. We need a navy, but to build a navy, we need ports, and the best ports for that lie along the Dalmatian coast."
 ser_secure_croatia_desc:0 "Croatia, or the duchies of Zagreb and Slavonia, have in the last few centuries changed hand so often, that just the names of their rulers fills whole books. This in many ways mirrors the situation Serbia has been in in the past. But now that the duchies are united and under the protection of the empire, they pose a great threat to our country. We have to somehow deal with that."
 ser_invade_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria has for many centuries been the counterweight to both the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantines. Neither could gain the advantage over the other, without the help or at least the approval of Bulgaria. An outcome, the Bulgarians would of course never let come to pass. Switching sides nearly every other years has proven to be a good strategy for many years, but the internal struggles of the Byzantines and the strengthening of the Emperor in Bohemia has turned out to be disastrous for them, and for the last two centuries their power is shrinking. They already had to give up Slavonia, and make concessions to the Transylvanians, and only a uneasy deal struck with the Slovak nobility saved them form even greater loss of power. Now is our time to strike, and deal them their finishing blow."
 ser_the_slovak_crown_desc:0 "The crown of Nitra is a object of great desire for every eastern European monarch. Many have claim on it, but few were able lay in on their head. Slovakia is rich in ore, wood, farmland, and people, and also of great strategic value, for everybody who seeks to dominate the Pannonian basin. The region could also be used to launch invasion into Austria, Poland, Silesia, Moravia or Bohemia. We simply have to be the ones to claim the crown of Nitra once and for all."
 ser_king_of_pannonia_desc:0 "The conquest of Nitra and Dacia has finally made us the dominant power in the Pannonina basin. Now that the region is under our control, we shall absorb the last remnants of the former powers, and develop the region, to serve as our new powerbase, as we extend our influence far beyond it, into Poland and the Empire."
 ser_unite_duchies_desc:0 "Far to long has our country been split in two. Century long meddling by both the Empire and the Byzantines has led to the creation of two Serbias. In the north, the Duchy of Belgrade, ally of the Byzantine emperors in Constantinople, champion of the Orthodox cause in Illyria, and in the south the Duchy of Montenegro, established with the help of the German emperor to serve as a save haven for all oppressed Catholics of the southern Balkan. Now that both powers are occupied far away form the Balkan, it is our time to unite was should have never been parted, eliminate our rival duchy, and with it the Heresy it stands for."
 ser_claim_arberian_throne_desc:0 "The receding Byzantine influence in the Balkans, left behind a number of small duchies and kingdoms, without anybody to rule them. While regions like Serbia or Croatia had a strong nobility, Arberia was just a mess of tribes, self-governing municipalities and the remnants of Byzantine administration. To end the everlasting power struggle, the factions finally invited an outsider to be their first king. If came to be, that a Serbian noble was chosen for this task. Even if the original Serbian ruling dynasty of Arberia died out in direct line a long time ago, so can our royal house trace their line to a distant cousin. It is only right, that we reassert our old rights, and reclaim Arberia for ourselves."
 ser_take_macedonia_desc:0 "Serbian communities could once be found deep in the south, and early Serbian leaders even tried to extend their influence to the shores of the Aegean Sea. Though their ambitions were not successful back than, with our strength growing by the day, now is the time to strike and succeed where they could not!"
 ser_reclaim_the_south_desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors used to raid deep into Greek lands, even penetrating the Peloponnese. These lands have always been of great desire to our people, and we must strive to take them for ourselves once and for all."
 take_constantinople_desc:0 "Constantinople is one of the most holy and venerable cities in Europe, and it behooves us to bring it and its hinterland under our control, where it can magnify our righteous glory and we can bring it into a realm worthy of its own majesty."
 ser_imperium_romanum_serboriumque_desc:0 "Our mighty lands straddle the width of the Balkans, and our power in unparalleled. It is time we reassert our true status, and have all in our lands and beyond our borders recognize us as an empire. There already are many voices that call us the third coming of the Roman empire. We shall make sure this will come to be so, and show everybody the might of the Imperium Serbiorum."
 ser_strenghten_the_church_desc:0 "Our faith is a strong one, but it could be stronger still. Our church needs our help in order to gain the authority and unity it rightfully deserves, and in return the church will gain some confidence in us."
 ser_deal_with_heresie_desc:0 "The Greeks have of late struggled to protect the true Faith in the Balkans. This solemn duty now falls on our shoulders, and we must do what we can to defend the people with the shield of our authority. And the first thing we have to do, is to take care of the Bogomil Heresy, one way or the other."
 ser_st_sava_the_uniter_desc:0 "Saint Sava is the most important saint of Serbia, and it's patron saint, so it is no wonder he is held in so high esteem by the people. It is astounishig though, that the founder of the Serbian Orthodox church would also be loved by the Catholics and other sects, and worshiped as a saint by them too. But it is so, and maybe we should take this as a sign, that we should leave the religious divide of the past in the past. Let Saint Sava unite us all, for we are all Christians after all."

The Tatars have neglected these lands for far too long, and rather relied on raids on neighboring nations than on framing and developing the land. With a strong economy established, we will be able to fuel our future conquests."

If we are to survive, we have to strike first, and secure our eastern flank."

Only the Tatar invasion from the north, and the Turkic attack from the south have put a temporary stop to that rivalry.

 georgian_unite_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia, the Nation of Saint George, has been broken under the onslaught of the Mongol and Turkic Invasion. Now most of the Georgian Lords swear fealty to the Azerbaijanis, and solely Imereti has managed to stay somewhat independent. It is time, that we reunite the realm, and from Georgia once again."
 georgian_invade_the_north_desc:0 "As century long rivalry connects us to Circassia, our neighbor to the North. We both were decimated by the aftermath of the Mongol invasion. While we had to endure the Turkic and later Azerbaijani rule, they were plagued by the Tatar hordes. Now that the power of the nomads dwindles, the old conflict will surely flame up again. We should lead a preemptive attack against them, so we can nip them in the bud."
 georgian_take_eastern_armenia_desc:0 "Eastern Armenia, or Karabakh, as it is usually called has once been an important province of the short-lived Greater Georgian kingdom. They too were decimated by the Mongol invasion, and has yet to recover. It is time we reclaim our hold over the region, and become it's masters once again."
 georgia_defeat_the_black_sheep_desc:0 "The Azerbaijani Qara Qoyunlu, called the Black Sheep federation, has long been the bane of our existence. After the Fall of the Mongol Khanate, they established themselves as the masters of the Caucasus, and took possession of most of Georgia. It is time to pay them back and finally shear the Black Sheep."
 georgia_fortify_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia with it's mountains and narrow valleys is a natural fortress. This has to our great shame not been made use of in the past though. With the right placement of castles and fortifications, no enemy will be able to invade our lands ever again. We will make the whole country into a bastion, able to weather even the greatest storm."

 byz_min_gain_independance_desc:0 "The power of the once mighty Byzantine empire is fading, and we are mostly free of dominance from Constantinople. However, to be truly free, and to prove that we are worthy of forging our own path, we have to gain allies, build an army and cut any remaining ties to our old masters."
 byz_min_unite_culture_desc:0 "While we are now free of outside influences, there are still man and women of our people that are not. We have to take the responsibility onto us, to free them as well. Only with all people of our culture, living under our protection, we can look outwards onto new lands."
 byz_min_unite_greece_desc:0 "Now that all that share our culture, are free, we have to extend this to all the peoples of Greece. Macedonians, Aegean, Micrasiates and Moreans. All have to be protected under our rule. Only if we achieve this, we can claim to be the true new Byzantines, protectors of all Greece."

 #Descriptions
 
 sjk_three_eagles_desc:0 "In the west, the old giant is failing. The Byzantine Empire, dominating Anatolia and many lands beyond, seems to be finally on his last breath. A new dynastic crisis seems to be on the horizon, and many predict, this will break the empire at last. This could be our chance to reclaim the western Turkish lands, and make us a major power again, but we must not act with precipitation and strike too soon. The best thing would be to wait and see where the winds of fate will carry us." 
 sjk_conquer_ikonion_desc:0 "Many years ago, when the Seljuk empire stretched from Anatolia to India, many of our people settled in Cappadocia, and mingled with the local Greek population. We still claim this region as ours, and consider the Cappadocians as our kin. Let's show them our brotherly love."
 sjk_attack_micrasia_desc:0 "When the Seljuk empire reached it's peak, it controlled nearly the whole of Anatolia. Solely the coastal Byzantine settlements managed to hold out. Back then, we lacked any naval power, so Byzantines supported the Micrasiate people with regular supply shipments. This time we will be better prepared."
 sjk_take_the_aegean_desc:0 "The many islands of the Aegean have already proven once, that the are one of the greatest dangers for our realm. If they are not secured, we will always be vulnerable against an Invasion from the West. It's time to put a stop to that."
 sjk_invade_crete_desc:0 "Crete is the pearl of the Aegean. Not only is it the biggest of the islands, and a nearly impregnable military fortress, but also a key position of the eastern trade network from which you can control all goods flowing from Greece, Asia, the Black Sea and even Egypt. We simply have to take it."
 sjk_take_upper_moesia_desc:0 "Upper Moesia is key in the defense of our western holdings. Our position in Greece is still shaky, and enemies we have never faced before lurk to the north, eager to themselves be the ones to succeed the Byzantines. Let us destroy their hopes."
 sjk_integrate_the_cumans_desc:0 "As it turns out, we have found lost kinsmen, when we conquered Moesia. The Cumans not only seem to have a rather remarkable similar way of life, but also have Turkish origins. We shell integrate them into our realm."
 sjk_develop_ctesiphon_desc:0 "In the olden times, in the days of the Seljuk empire, Ctesiphon the one city that came closest to resemble something like a capital of the widespread and decentralized country. Since then, it seems the holy city of Nestorianism had to endure hard times. It is time to once again make it the shining jewel of our empire."
 sjk_the_patriachate_desc:0 "The leader of Nestorianism, our pope if you like to call it that, has his seat in Ctesiphon, and so the city marks the center of the widespread Nestorian faith. And while the other great Christian denominations have their primary power to defend them, Nestorianism was always to decentralized. So it our duty, to assume that role, and become the guardians for all our brothers in faith, from the Steppes of Asia, to the islands of Indonesia."
 sjk_reclaim_pontus_desc:0 "The region of Pontus was, due to it's excellent defensibility, always hard to both subdue and control. It is time that we finally put an end to the Greek presence at our northern coast, and put Pontus and Trebizond under our rule."
 sjk_invade_taurike_desc:0 "Beyond the Black Sea, there lies the Crimean peninsula, from where one can assert dominance over the whole region, if they know what they are doing. It is wasted on Greeks and Goths, and god forbid, the Tatars. It is only natural that we take it, and keep it to our benefit."
 sjk_invade_trace_desc:0 "It is said, that Constantinople is the most beautiful city in the world. Sadly we wouldn't know, for to cross the Bosporus, was the one thing the old Seljuk Khagans never were able to achieve. It is time that we finally rectify that, and take the city of the worlds desire for ourselves. This will open all of Greece to us."
 sjk_conquer_macedonia_desc:0 "The mountainous region of Macedonia is the last great bastion of Greek resistance, and by taking it we can finally make our final push south. Though it will be hard to conquer all those mountain forts and passes, it will be worth it in the end, for from there we can even go further West."
 sjk_unite_greece_desc:0 "The time is near, that the last of the Greek realms falls under our control. Long they have been our enemies, but when Morea has fallen, it is time to think about the future and the past alike. We already have more Greeks subjects than Turks, and while some small minded people say, that this will only make us all to Cappadocians, we think we shall embrace that union, and our new citizens. This will make us the true heirs of Rome - a claim first put forth, when the Seljuks were failing in the East, and were putting their hope into the west, but destroyed all chances to it with unnecessary cruelty. We will not make that mistake again."
 sjk_protect_haasa_desc:0 "When the Seljuk empire reigned across Asia, they soon set their eyes on Arabia. There the Alid Caliphate was suppressing the few remaining Christians of the peninsular. Especially the area around the Peninsula of Catara, where still many Nestorians lived, was in grave danger of being forcefully converted by those heathens. Back then our great Khagans stepped in and came to their aid, and established the March of Haasa. Today they are threatened once again, so we shall do like our ancestors did, and invite them back under our protection." 
 sjk_the_catara_treaty_desc:0 "When the March of Haasa was established as a tributary of the Seljuk empire, an agreement - Catara treaty - the was made, on how the union of this two countries should be of benefit for all. The Haasa would put their navy into the service of the Seljuks, for their planned push into India, and transport supplies and troops around the inaccessible Baluchistan to Sindh, while the Seljuk army would help in a holy war against the heathen Muslims to bring back the word of Christ to the whole of Arabia. While this plans failed due to the Greek rebellion, the situation we face today is nearly the same, so it would only make sense to reinstate the Catara treaty with the same terms. We get their navy for India, and they get Arabia."
 sjk_unite_armenia_desc:0 "With western Armenia now firmly under our control, it is time to face east, towards those lands, they call Karabakh. The mountainous region is a stronghold of the Armenians and the Qara Qoyunlu alike, and has to be dealt with, before we make any further pushes south or east. It would be too easy to encircle us otherwise."
 sjk_conquer_syria_desc:0 "It is often said, that northern Syria was the bane of the Seljuk empire, for what should have been another fast conquest, would become a never ending struggle between them and the Egyptians. The region drained the empires coffers faster then they could be refilled, and when, after many years, the fight was finally won, the empire was close to bursting at it's seams, and the region reverted to the Egyptians soon later. This time, we will keep it, and push even further south."
 sjk_invade_mesopotamia_desc:0 "The region of Mesopotamia was once the crown jewel of the great Seljuk empire, and will be again, once we clear out these useless Mongol remnants. The times, that we bow to their rule are long over, and the region will be ours once again."
 sjk_conqer_kurdistan_desc:0 "While the failed Indian invasion, and the Greek rebellion, heralded the end of our great empire, it was the Kurdish general Selahedînê that truly broke was was left of our realm, and ensured that we would stay restricted to eastern Anatolia for centuries. It's time to pay the Kurds back our 'debt' - with interest!"
 sjk_take_beth_nahrain_desc:0 "Babylon is the final piece of the puzzle to reunite the former heart of our empire, and reclaiming all of Mesopotamia. Now the region in controlled by Beth Nahrain, another mere Mongol successor state, even if the claim otherwise. They too shall fall as their old masters did."
 sjk_invade_arabia_desc:0 "The first steps to reconnecting the empire to it's former eastern holdings are done. While we would have preferred to do this with our old allies in Haasa at our side, the times may not be ready for this. We can no longer wait to invade Arabia and the valuable island of Hormuz, that will secure us from the south."
 sjk_invade_oman_desc:0 "Oman is one of the richest regions in all of the world. Their opportunistic approach to religion and trade - the strictly keep them apart - has allowed them to establish a great trading network, and a vast knowledge on marine warfare. We will need both, for our push into India."
 sjk_dominate_indian_trade_desc:0 "With Sindh in our hands, the real treasure is finally ours. The trade in the Indian Ocean will make us richer then other empire ever was. This will fuel all our further conquests, and if we are smart about it, we can at the same time starve out our enemies."
 sjk_reconquer_armenia_desc:0 "When our empire crumbled, Armenia was one of the first provinces to rebel. Though they were also the last province that was lost, it shows that they are fiercely independent and will not easily bow to us as their masters. But it is essential, that we reclaim western Armenia. If we can't do that, we should not even attempt to go further."
 sjk_overthrow_the_sassanids_desc:0 "In the north of Persia, in the lands of Tabarestan, there lays the Nestorian kingdom of Mazadaran. This should normally make us allies, against the Zoroastrian menace, were it not for the fact, that their kings, the Dabuyids, calim to be descendants of the accursed Sassanids, our old enemies. Even if most laugh about their claim, we take it as an insult to us. Let us show them that we know a thing or two about slaughtering Sassanids." 
 sjk_invade_persia_desc:0 "Persia is the greatest empire in the middle East, and rightfully belongs to us. The Seljuks laid claim to it many centuries ago, and wanted to liberate it from the evil Sassanids in the name of Christ our lord and master. Since then, it seems, nothing has changed, as the evil Zoroastrians still plague the land and oppress the Christians living there. It's time to liberate Persia once more."
 sjk_take_khorasan_desc:0 "East of Persia lies a land ravaged by centuries of war and strife, and nothing seems to have changed since the time we reigned here. Still the nomads from the steppes raid the towns, and Christians, Manichaeans and Zoroastrians fight against each other. We will be the one's who finally brings peace to this part of the world."
 sjk_subdue_pars_desc:0 "The last holdout of Persia is the Southern lands of Pars. Defended by the Zagros, it is hardest to invade, but now that we control North, West and East, we should have no problems to claim even that unruly part of Persia."
 sjk_invade_baluchistan_desc:0 "Baluchistan is a inhospitable land full of mountains, deserts, bandits and heathens. Not many venture there, and all who can avoid it, take the save route along the coast. To conquer it, will not bring us any closer to invading India, as no army can be marched trough it, and expected to fight on the other side, but we can at least secure the coast and stop the bandit raids into our lands."
 sjk_take_on_sindh_desc:0 "Long ago, the Seljuk Khagans were planing an expedition into India, to finally stomp out the last remnants of their old enemies, the Juganavids. They were an rival Turkic horde, the Seljuks originally were tributaries of, but when they started to follow the heretical Manichaean faith, our forefathers broke with them, and freed Persia and Khwarasan from their unjust rule. But just when it looked like they could finally extinguish that evil, the Byzantine revolt flared up in Anatolia, and the armies, that should have crossed the Indus the very next day, had to be turned around, and marched back with haste. This time we will take Sindh once and for all."
 sjk_into_the_punjab_desc:0 "With Sindh fallen, it is time to march North, and face the battle-hardened Punjabis, masters of the Indus. This campaign will be hard and costly, but in the end worth the risk, as holding the Punjab, will open our way into the fertile valleys of North India."
 sjk_owerthrow_the_yamag_desc:0 "In our history, our faith has been often tested. We faced heretical Christians, Zoroastrians and Muslims, and we never failed, but one religious group has been a plight on the Turkish tribes from the very beginning. Many of our people joined the false promises of the evil Manichaean priests, and swore allegiance to their accursed Yamag. It is time to wipe out the Yamagnate and the Shahdom of Delhi that protects them."
 sjk_the_aral_shores_desc:0 "The first home our people every knew, was the steppes around mighty lake Aral. While it was only temporary, the lands hold sentimental value to us. It is time that we bring those lands back under our control." 
 sjk_shear_the_black_sheep_desc:0 "The Azerbaijani Qara Qoyunlu, called the Black Sheep federation, came to these lands not a century ago, in the wake of the Mongol invasion, and after their fall they established themselves as the new masters of Armenia and the Caucasus. Though they are our brothers in faith and due to their Turkish origin, we have a stronger claim to their lands. It is time to show this upstarts, that everything they pride themselves on, we have already masted centuries ago."
 sjk_strenghten_persian_christians_desc:0 "The Nestorian faith has long spread through the lands of Persia, and there were always communities of Christians within the empire. Especially under our ancestors rule, they could thrive, but nowadays, they are oppressed once again by the Zoroastrians. It is time to change that."
 sjk_deal_with_the_zoroastrians_desc:0 "Our conversion efforts have mostly been successful, but there are still pockets of the heathen Zoroastrians within Persia. It is time to show them the true way of our Lord Jesus Christ. If need demands it, even with force."
 sjk_estinguish_the_flames_desc:0 "Persia is finally cleansed of the Zoroastrian heathens, but there are still countries in this world, that shelter communities of them, and our spies tell us, their is talk within them, to fight a holy war against us to recover the temples of the holy flames. It is time to prove to them, that their flames will never be lit again and that their god has forsaken them."
 sjk_pacify_the_pashtun_desc:0 "The Pashtun are an unruly people in the inaccessible highlands of East Khwarasan. In fact they are so problematic to control and subdue, that many would like to just ignore their presence, were it not for the fact, that they control the easier northern route into India. We will find ways to conquer the lands against all odds, we are sure."
 sjk_conqer_baktria_desc:0 "In the East there is a land, that shares many similarities to us, but like in a mirror. While we are a people, that build a great empire, journeyed far, came to settle in Greek lands, and adopted many of their customs, they claim to be the remnants of the ancient empire of the great Greek general Alexander. We should integrate their lands into ours, and show that we are as great as he was."
 sjk_protect_samarkand_desc:0 "It was in Samarkand, that our first great leader Seljuk first saw the light of Christ, and converted to Nestorianism. For this fact alone, we have a duty do protect the city and the whole lands of Sogdia with it. It has for too long been threatened by heathens and raiders, and will prosper under our rule."
 sjk_integrate_the_turkmans_desc:0 "When our ancestors left the steppes, not all of the Turks followed them, and the people that is know today as the Turkmans is what is left of those who were cut off from us when the great Seljuk empire fell. Let us welcome our brothers back into the empire."
 sjk_the_southern_kirgiz_desc:0 "The lands of the southern Kirghiz mark the old easternmost border of the old Seljuk empire. Our empire already stretches from Greece to India, and with this we will finally unite the old realm, and live up to the legacy of our forefathers. Let's put the final piece of the puzzle into place."
 sjk_integrate_the_azeris_desc:0 "Just like our Turkish ancestors, the Azerbaijanis were also once under the Great Seljuk Empire as well and journeyed west along with them. However, after the demise of the Old Seljuk Khanate, our people have diverged on their own separate paths. Despite being at odds with our Azerbaijani brothers over the centuries, we must bring our wayward siblings back into the Turkish fold."

 #Descriptions
 
 byz_foi_restore_northern_border_desc:0 "Our northern Border has been violated one time too much. It is time that we show our European neighbors that this empire hasn't lost it's teeth yet. The border has to be restored."
 byz_foi_conquer_cumania_desc:0 "Initially a Byzantine march to protect our northern border against the constant raids by the Bulgars, the Cuman Confederation broke away from our rule in the late 13th century, and has now turned to violating our borders themselves. We will show them, that their freedom is only temporary. Moesia will be a part of the empire again."
 byz_foi_wallachia_desc:0 "North of the lower Danube, there lie the lands Wallachia, southern march of the Bulgarian empire, and one of the most fortified regions in all of Europe. Only if we control Wallachia, we can hope to further advance into Dacia and Pannonia."
 byz_foi_transylvania_and_moldavia_desc:0 "Dacia is made up of three regions. The March of Wallachia, the Duchy Transylvania - another Bulgar vassal - and the Duchy of Moldavia, which has been called the shield of Europe, as it has been a throne in the side of the Tatar hordes for long and destroyed many a raiding party on their way west. Only if we unite all of Dacia, under our rule, we can hope to regain our supremacy over south-eastern Europe."
 byz_foi_topple_bulgaria_desc:0 "The Bulgarian empire has long been the primary enemy of the Byzantine empire. After we pushed them out of Moesia during their initial invasion of the Balkans, they settled in Pannonia, mixing with and integrating what was left of the once mighty Avars. They long survived by playing us and the German Empire against each other, carefully not picking a side. But now that they seem on the decline, while both we and the Germans regained our strength, it is vital, that we strike first, and beat Prague to the punch."
 byz_foi_lombardy_desc:0 "With most of the Italian lands now firmly back under our control, it is time, that we regain our hold over the most prosperous region of Italy. Lombardy will be our next step on the path to restoring the empire to it's old glory!"
 byz_foi_arles_desc:0 "The regions of Savoy, Dauphine and Provence together make up the former kingdom of Arles. This region is not only nearly as prosperous as Lombardy, but it also will be our gate to invading Gaul."
 byz_foi_kyrenika_desc:0 "Cyrenaica was once one of the most important Greek colonies, and later a vital province of the Roman Empire. Even though it fell into the influence of the Coptic Egyptians long ago, and has been their dependency for centuries, it never lost it's connection to it's Greek and Orthodox roots. It is high time, that the Cyrenaica becomes part of out empire again."
 byz_foi_reestablish_apollonia_desc:0 "Apollonia was once the pride of the Cyrenaica, a harbor fit for processing goods from all over the Roman Empire, and a hub for people and trade alike. Since then it has long fallen into disrepair and ruin, and no ship can enter the silt filled port. It is time, that we rebuild Apollonia, and bring back it's glory."
 byz_foi_foothold_in_indic_desc:0 "Since Antiquity the Indian Ocean has been the center of the worlds most lucrative trade routes. Today, with the Western empires searching their fortune in the West, and even trying to escape our influence, by sailing south before east, we have to make sure to not fall behind and loose our importance as a mercantile powerhouse. A base in the Indian Ocean would be ideal, and we should try to befriend the Christian in the south of the Subcontinent, before the Lusitanians or English strike first."
 byz_foi_waystations_desc:0 "As the Americas seem out of reach - for now - our explorers push us to establish colonies in the newly discovered lands of Terra Australis. While we are not opposed to this, the distance is as of now still far to long to reliably support a colony form the Maldives. Once of the Islands in the Middle of the Indian Ocean will be key to a successful colonial venture."
 byz_foi_terra_australis_desc:0 "The new Colony in Australia as proven to be even of higher value than we could have ever dreamed. The lands are rich of luxury goods like gemstones and especially gold! We have to fully establish our control over the vast continent, and keep the other nations, from stealing what is ours."
 byz_foi_retake_arberia_desc:0 "Arberia has long been under our control, and it is a shame that our predecessors have proven so incapable that they let the region slip from their grasp. It is time that we retake Arberia and once again integrate it into the empire."
 byz_foi_conquer_balkans_desc:0 "When the province of Illyria finally slipped from our grasp, and the Balkans was lost to us, many already predicted the final fall of Rome, but we persevered. For centuries the Balkans was our battlefield with the Germans and the Bulgars, but this will end now, and the Roman Eagle and the Orthodox church will once again reign supreme over the region."
 byz_foi_illyrian_border_desc:0 "The northern part of Illyria has for long firmly been in the hands of the Franks and their successors. Croatia, Slavonia and Carniola have been made outright bastions, from which the Germans and Latins spread their foul influence far and wide. This has to end."
 byz_foi_anihilate_venice_desc:0 "The fat and treacherous merchants of 'The Most Serene Republic' have again and again been plotting our demise, bankrolling our enemies, and trying to sow the seed of discord in out ranks, to get their greedy hands on our islands and on our trade. Our recovery after the devastating period of civil war - the Venetians had undoubtedly had their hands in - has long been a source of concern in the Palazzo Ducale. The time is ripe to exact our gruesome vengeance and hang the Doge from his own walls!"
 byz_foi_the_eternal_city_desc:0 "Constantinople might be the New Rome, but the old Imperial capital, the Eternal City itself, has been lost since the fall of the Exarchate of Ravenna in 751. Now that our empire is nearly as strong again, as it was then, it is our most sacred duty to seek reunification with our ancient Latin home..."
 byz_foi_northern_italy_desc:0 "With Rome back in our hands, and law restored in the adjacent regions, we have to move north to Tuscany and the Romagna. The city states that reign their, may be born form the old Imperial democratic traditions, but greed and envy has corrupted them. It is time, they are brought back under our firm hand!"
 byz_foi_cartagena_desc:0 "When the Visigoths fell, all of their nobility fled to Cartagena - in former times known as Karthago Nova - and from there, they seek to reestablish themselves as the masters of Iberia. We can not let that happen. The shame alone, from loosing to a new Carthage would be too much."
 byz_foi_hispania_tarraconensis_desc:0 "The North-Eastern provinces of Iberia are mountainous, treacherous and full of enemies. But they are also one of the richest regions in Iberia. We simply must control the region, if we truly want to reestablish ourselves as Iberia's masters."
 byz_foi_narbonensis_desc:0 "Southern Gaul, or Toulouse as it is called today, is a rich and fertile region, a center of trade and commerce, and foremost, it is ours! We may never be able to regain the north of Gaul, too volatile has the situation become, as many nations now wrangle over the possession of Paris, but the south is stable enough, that we can control it."
 byz_foi_take_the_delta_desc:0 "Egypt is the breadbasket of the Mediterranean. The invasion of the Aq Qoyunlu, and the near utter defeat of the Egpytians has once already severely threatened our supplies. As our population grows and grows, we can not risk any more grain shortages. We have to take control of the Nile Delta ourselves."
 byz_foi_upper_egypt_desc:0 "With the Delta now firmly in our hands, the voices are growing louder and louder, that we should retake all of Egypt and return to the old Roman borders. The Coptic Kingdom is already doomed, so why not take advantage of this?"
 byz_foi_lower_nubia_desc:0 "Nubia has always been an object of desire for our forefathers, but back then, the region was too underdeveloped to be controlled, and the Roman Empire was stretched to thin already. Today we do not face this challenges anymore. Nubia is ours!"
 byz_foi_upper_nubia_desc:0 "Now that we control Lower Nubia, the Upper Nubian Kingdoms have become a problem. They raid in our countryside, support the rebels and all in all try to make the live of our subjects as miserable as possible. This will end now!"
 byz_foi_ethiopian_highlands_desc:0 "Ethiopia is a land of wonder and legend. Not only is it said that the Nile has one of it's major sources in this region, but this hills and mountains hold vast quantities of gold - more that any man could even dream of. After all it is said, that somewhere here lay the legendary mines of King Solomon himself."
 byz_foi_invade_sumatra_desc:0 "Laying on the strait of Malacca, Sumatra is ideally situated to become our first colony in the South East Asia. The court has long pressured the Imperial Navy to find a way to procure spices to a more reasonable price, and this could be the first step towards that goal."
 byz_foi_unite_the_island_desc:0 "Now that Northern Sumatra is under our control, we have to push south and smoke out the last pockets against our resistance. We are sure the oppressed Christians on the Island will welcome us 'rescuing' them."
 byz_foi_the_three_eagles_war_desc:0 "Long years of weak and susceptible emperors ground the once great Roman Empire to a halt. The long reign of the Komnenoi Emperors has brought even more internal turmoil within the Byzantine Empire. Due to corruption and weak and incompetent leadership the state apparatus itself is nearly broken. Even the reforms and rather peaceful reign of Ioannes VIII couldn't change the rotten core of the empire. His son Konstantinos Andronikos is ready to follow in his father's path, and he is generally loved by the people and the aristocracy alike, but his health has always been - rather unpredictable. Should he - god forbid it - pass on before his time, the country could again face serious internal strife, as his succession is rather disputed. The mighty families of the Angeloi and Palaiologoi are ready to contest the Komnenoi claim on the imperial throne, and some even predict a 'War of the Three Eagles'. While this could finally break the empire for good, it could also be a chance for change. The fate is in our hands."
 byz_foi_rebuild_the_army_desc:0 "In the long period of instability, that lead up to the 'Three Eagles War', that the Imperial army fell into serious disrepair. Even though the Eagle's war veterans are now better drilled than before, their equipment is still outdated, and their numbers are few, as there has been much reliance on mercenaries in the past. We have to strengthen the army, and once again make it to the strongest in all the world."
 byz_foi_rebuild_the_navy_desc:0 "In the long period of instability, that lead up to the 'Three Eagles War', that the Imperial navy fell into serious disrepair. The number of vassals we own, has dropped to an all time low, and upstarts like Venice or Trinakria have taken to harassing our merchants. We will have to construct new shipyards, to build up our naval strength again, as it is fitting for a nation with such a rich seafaring history."
 byz_foi_secure_cyprus_desc:0 "Even though it has been in Egyptian hands for the better part of the last four-hundred years, Cyprus is still part of the Greek sphere of influence and culture. This made it an important meeting place between us and the Egyptians, but now, with Memphis not even able to hold it's own borders, it is time, that Cyprus returns into our loving arms."
 byz_foi_magna_graecia_desc:0 "Contrary to the rest of Italy, the southern parts are still orthodox and mostly Greek dominated. Magna Grecia has long been a stronghold of Byzantine rule, and especially in Kalavaria and Apoulia we still have much influence. What is worrying though, is that the region of Neapolis is getting more and more Catholic and Latin. We have to lay claim to Magna Grecia to protect our Griko brothers."
 byz_foi_secure_sicily_desc:0 "Sicily, once a vital province of the empire, is dominated today by the republic of Trinakria, an oligarchy of merchants, who are amassing more and more wealth, on the backs of their people, and probably by piracy. Even though we can prove nothing, it is high time, that the island returns to our rule."
 byz_foi_take_western_isles_desc:0 "Corsica, Sardinia and the Baleares, while themselves not valuable provinces, are of unmatched strategic value. To reintegrate them into the empire is of vital importance, if we want to reestablish ourselves in the Western Mediterranean and more importantly Hispania."
 byz_foi_invade_hispania_desc:0 "The coast of Hispania represents the limit of what was regained under the glorious emperor Justinian, before the plague destroyed his ambitions. Today, we are in a similarly strong position as he was, and nothing will stop us, form at least catching up to him. Hispania will be ours again."
 byz_foi_take_lusitania_desc:0 "The kings of Lusitania have the finest shipwrights, most modern vassals and best captains, but their army is weak compared to ours. We have to strike now, before their newly established colonies can make them even more wealthy that they already have become, for then they could outlast us simply funneling more and more money into their armies."
 byz_foi_take_galicia_and_navarra_desc:0 "The Galicians and Basque have two of the finest armies in all of Europe. While too small for being a real threat to us, their troops could be used as mercenaries against us. Let them become the next step on our path to reclaiming all of Iberia."
 byz_foi_colonial_ambitions_desc:0 "The colonies in the Caribbean have become a way-station of all the riches passing over from the New World to the Old. With Mauretania and Western Iberia firmly under our control, it is time to get into the colonial game ourselves."
 byz_foi_palestine_desc:0 "The Holy Land has far too long been in the hands of heretics. It is time to liberate all the most holy sites of Christendom. Jerusalem has to fall into our hands again, no matter the price."
 byz_foi_take_red_sea_ports_desc:0 "While some of the trade from Asia has begun to flow around the southern tip of Africa, most of it still passes either through the silk road, or the Red Sea. We should seize some of the ports along the upper Red Sea, and take our part of the riches that flow to us from India, China and even farther away."
 byz_foi_axum_desc:0 "Since the first century the mighty kingdom of Axum reigns on the Nubian Coast. This giant has long been in decline, especially since Ethiopia broke away from them during the 11th century. While they are still fabulously rich from the Indian Ocean trade, we should use their apparent martial weakness, and make Axum the newest province of our great empire."
 byz_foi_the_horn_desc:0 "The Horn of Africa is dominated by a mix of Miaphysite theocracies, petty kingdoms and merchant republics. Here all the riches of the East African Coast arrive and are sent towards Europe and Asia. We have to add this rich province to our empire."
 byz_foi_malaya_desc:0 "The Malay peninsula is not only a stronghold of the Buddhist heathens, but also a mercantile powerhouse. With it under our control we can spread Christianity all over the region, and incidentally take control over the Straits of Malacca, and all the trade that flows through it..."
 byz_foi_secure_borneo_desc:0 "Borneo is a island controlled by both Hindu and Nestorian Christian kingdoms, and will be the crown in our Southest Asian Colonial empire. With it, we will control a major part of the valuable spice trade. Something the court has been pushing for long."
 byz_foi_secure_taurike_desc:0 "The kingdoms on the Crimean Peninsula have since antiquity provided us with an alternative to Egyptian grain shipments, vital for the growing population of our cities. The Tatar invasion has destroyed much of the agricultural value of this region, but securing Taurike for the Empire will nevertheless allow us firmer control of the Black Sea trade."
 byz_foi_georgia_desc:0 "The mountainous region of Georgia is a natural fortress against dangers from the steppes. If we can secure the region, we can fortify it even more, and make sure that we are in future secure from dangers beyond the Caucasus."
 byz_foi_take_armenia_desc:0 "Armenia has always been both one of the most important provinces of the empire, and one of the most problematic. Not only do the Armenians adhere to the Miaphysite heresy, the constant warfare on their land, has made them into formidable fighters. We have to regain the region, or we one day will face the danger of an emerging Armenian empire."
 byz_foi_upper_kurdistan_desc:0 "From Kurdistan came our doom. The Warlord Selahedînê - we call him Saladin - dealt our then struggling empire during the 12th century such a devastating blow, when we were finally on the path of finishing off the Seljuk Turks, that we were nowhere ready, when the Mongol invasion hit only decades later. It is time to repay the favor."
 byz_foi_western_crusaders_desc:0 "Out of the doom of the Tadmunite empire, two might crusader states arose in the eastern Barbarie. Tripolitania and Carthago. If we ever want to reestablish ourselves in Africa, we first have to subdue those two. Especially the Crusene Lords of Carthago will prove to be challenge."
 byz_foi_crusader_coast_desc:0 "Along the coast, from Kabylia to Port di Dieu, lie the smaller Crusader states of Kabylia and Agadir and lands of the Holy Order of the Knights Templar. While small in size, all three have highly skilled armies at their disposal, and should not be taken lightly."
 byz_foi_control_the_hinterland_desc:0 "The interior of the Eastern Barbarie is controlled by the remnants of the once great heretical Imwehheden empire, and the Catholic Berber kingdoms. To stop them herassing our coastal holding, we have to conquer them once and for all."
 byz_foi_mauretania_desc:0 "The Western Barbarie is home to the mighty and wealthy nation of Mauretania - Probably the only nation in all of Africa that could really oppose our hold on the Continent. Their access to the Atlantic coast and their relative religious freedom has brought them much wealth and many allies. But we are sure we will prevail anyway."
 byz_foi_greater_syria_desc:0 "Greater Syria and the region of Lebanon have long been a hotbed of the Monothelite heresy, a heresy that, we are sorry to say, was created by our predecessors in a feeble attempt to reconvene with the Miaphysite church. It is time to right that past wrong, and reintegrate Lebanon into our empire."
 byz_foi_ghassanids_desc:0 "Once the Ghassanids were our march against the encroaching Muslims beyond the river Jordan. This days are long past, but the Ghassanids still stand strong, protecting the Holy Land form the heathens. If we restore their lands into our empire, we should consider making them our march again."
 byz_foi_invade_hejaz_desc:0 "The region of Hejaz was the birthplace of the cursed Muslim heathens, and the conquest of their holiest cities, of Mecca and Medina, will forever cripple them. This will be the first step in bringing the true faith back to Arabia."
 byz_foi_secure_inner_arabia_desc:0 "The deserts of Central Arabia are harsh and unforgiving, and the tribes that inhabit them are fierce and not easily subdued. Nevertheless we have to master this challenge on our path to greatness."
 byz_foi_free_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen, or Arabia Felix, as it was called in Roman times, is not only one of the wealthiest regions on the whole planet, but also a major stronghold of Christianity in Arabia. It is time, that we put them under our protection."
 byz_foi_tame_the_kindah_desc:0 "The Jewish pirates of the Kindah tribe, were once another desert dwelling Arabian tribal federation, but with the rise of the Caliphate, they were pushed out of their old homeland, and settled t the southern Arabian coast between the rich mercantile centers of Oman and Yemen. The perfect place to discover piracy. We should make sure, they work for and not against us."
 byz_foi_convert_anatolia_desc:0 "Eastern Anatolia has never fully embraced the true faith. It is high time to cleanse the region of all the heresies that took root here over the centuries."
 byz_foi_deal_with_the_heresies_desc:0 "The Holy Land and Mesopotamia, the cradles of Christianity are still full of heretical countries. We have to make sure, that the people are only ruled by us, or other true believers, so they may find their way back unto to right path."
 byz_foi_retake_pontus_desc:0 "During the Byzantine Civil War, a rouge Komnenoi prince declared independence from Constantinople, and with the help of the Qara Qoyunlu established a small kingdom in the Pontus region around Trebizond. With the rest of the country united again it is time, that also this renegade region returns under the rightful rule of our Basileus."
 byz_foi_tame_the_turks_desc:0 "In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks rode west and destroyed everything in their path. After Persia and Armenia fell into their greedy hands, they turned their eyes to us, and swept through Anatolia like a deadly plague. And yet we persevered. Against all odds, the Micrasiate coast held out, and we were eventually able to push them back to Armenikon. This is were they still live to this day, but what once was a horde of screaming madmen on horseback, is not a nearly civilized society. It is time we integrate them in our empire, and teach them how to be good citizens."
 byz_foi_integrate_ikonion_desc:0 "Ikonion is neither a Greek state, nor a Turkish state, but something rather odd in between. The Doukids managed to wrestle Cappadocia form us after the fall of the Mongols, and it is time to end their 'stewardship'."
 byz_foi_recover_antioch_desc:0 "Higher Syria will be our fist step to the reconquest of the Holy Land. It's most important city, Antiochia was a center of early Christianity during the time of the Romans. The Jews converted here by the apostle Peter were the first to be called Christians. Since then, Antioch has seen many wars and known many masters. In the 13th century the city fell to the Mongols and its entire Christian population was put to the sword. Even today, Syria is ruled by the Mongol rump state of the Jalayirids. We have to finally liberate the region."
 byz_foi_assyria_desc:0 "Assyria, or Upper Mesopotamia, has always been an object of desire of our nation, and finally it seems in our reach. The cursed Mongols are in their final throws. It is time to bring Assyria into the empire."
 byz_foi_babylon_desc:0 "Lower Mesopotamia in general, and it's capital Ctesiphon in particular, is the center of Nestorian heresy. Today it is ruled a failing Mongol vassal called Beth Nahrain, that, we are sure, will pose no resistance whatsoever. Let us conquer the region, and cleanse it of this heresy."
 byz_foi_protect_haasa_desc:0 "The Haasa are the one of only remaining Christian tribes in Arabia, and once served a similar function to the Seljuk Turks, as the Ghassanids did for us. It is our duty to protect our fellow Christians, even if they are heretics, and to ensure this, we have to bring them under the protection of our administration."
 byz_foi_take_oman_desc:0 "The merchant republic of Oman with it's tributaries in India and East Africa has amassed an incredible amount of wealth. A wealth we need for our ever growing empire. While their navy is the strongest in the Indian Ocean, their only defense from land was the disunity of the Arab tribes and the vast Rub' al Khali. They will be easy prey."

 bul_ruthenian_alliance_desc:0 "Bulgaria and Galicia-Kiev share a long history. Always natural allies against the encroaching influence of the great powers of the region and, more recently Bulgaria became the first supporter of Galician independence against the Mongol yoke, finally allowing the Ruthenias to be free once again. However, some in our court would seek to distance us from the Ruthenians. We should take action one way or another."
 bul_vassal_states_desc:0 "Our rule over Wallachia has always been shaky at best. Especially after the Bulgarian compromise in the aftermath of the death of Boris IV, they act increasingly independent. It is time to finally put them under direct administration once and for all."
 bul_vassal_states_three_desc:0 "The Serbian state is splinted and broken in two, with the empires of the Germans and the Greeks threatened their borders. We consider that plea for guidance to still be valid. Bring them into the fold."
 bul_vassal_states_four_desc:0 "Bosnia, Croatia and Dalmatia, states as broken as Serbia, should be in thrall to us, their rightful overlords. Nations as pitiful as this cannot be expected to defend itself against internal revolts, let alone the Empire or the Greeks. Whilst we are at it, we should drive the Italians from our shores and remove one more threat to our rule."
 bul_vassal_states_two_desc:0 "Moldavia has swapped hands more times than we can count. Clearly, however, we have the most legitimate claim to their land."
 bul_take_galicia_desc:0 "The mighty Polish [POL.GovernmentName] control the lands across our north-eastern border. There growing power would pose a significant threat to our independence and those of our old allies, the Ruthenians, were they to become hostile. We should make a preemptive strike to push back the Polish border further from our heartlands, or try to establish a buffer in the southern Polish lands. And should the Ruthenian people seek our protection from the growing power of Poland anyway, we shall be happy to provide it."
 bul_ruthenian_union_desc:0 "Upon the Independence of the Ruthenians from the Mongol yoke, a union was proposed between Bulgaria and Galicia-Kiev, by a marriage of the crown prince of Bulgaria, and the princess of Galicia. Even if this Union ultimately failed, our nation stayed close allies since then. We should try to finally form this union between our thrones that should have always been - and ensure a prosperous future for both our nations."
 bul_cuman_borders_desc:0 "It is time we put up a defense against the cursed Cuman raiders. To finally be rid of their constant incursions, we shall establish a secure border, and fortify our territory. This will be the end of the Cuman plague."
 bul_cuman_borders_two_desc:0 "Originally established as a direct counter to us, the former Byzantine march of Cumania has long since asserted their independence and taken to raiding into every direction possible. The Cuman Federation had to be subdued to secure the security of our nation."
 bul_cuman_borders_three_desc:0 "The Byzantines have undermined our efforts of expansion in the Balkans for too long. It is time to eject them from our realm, and add Macedonia to our kingdom!"
 bul_cuman_borders_four_desc:0 "From the moment our forefathers entered the Balkans, our history was dominated by our struggle with the Byzantine empire. They first pushed us out of Silistria into Pannonia, where we had to face the Avars, and when we established ourselves, they tried to subjugate us. But we persisted and stood strong. It is time we conquer the great city of Constantinople, and once and for all assert our position as the new dominant power in the East!"
 bul_bulwark_of_orthodoxy_desc:0 "As the new principal defenders of Orthodoxy against the Catholic threat and it's cursed heresies, we have come to be known as the Bulwark of Orthodoxy. By demonstrating our ability to match anything the heretics in the so-called 'Holy Roman Empire' and beyond can throw at us, we can ensure that this title is thoroughly deserved."
 bul_magyar_mercenaries_desc:0 "Surrounded by many enemies, the Bulgarian army has ample practice at guarding the independence of our state. But we may not rest on our laurels - we must continue to hone our skills so that we do not lose the cutting edge that the excellence of our armed forces provides. For this we have to especially promote the Madzhari, the forces drafted form the Magyar population of our country and the Szeklers of Transylvania, and key of many our victory."
 bul_fund_monasteries_desc:0 "The many monasteries of the Bulgarian countryside have always been places of both learning and hard labour. Many areas rely on the agricultural produce grown by these holy man to bring them through harsh winters, and that is why they have a very high standing in society. Setting aside funds to ensure their goodwill towards the state would be a sound investment."
 bul_religious_unity_desc:0 "Bulgaria's territories are home to people of many different beliefs. One way or another, we must ensure that religious differences do not divide our state."
 bul_improve_economy_desc:0 "Our ability to compete as a Great Power wedged between a host of potential threats is dependent on our ability to scrape every last bit of wealth from our lands."

 bul_pressburg_university_desc:0 "We should establish a center of religious and secular learning, where the next generation of thinkers who will support the growth of our nation will be nurtured."
 bul_great_city_of_pest_desc:0 "The Bulgarian state has endured for centuries, and our capital has grown to become an important city. However, it is dwarfed in size and in grandeur by Prague, Steyr and Vienna, the capitals of our western rivals. It would be a fine day were [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to outstrip the other two and come to be considered as the principal city of Central Europe."
 bul_strong_government_desc:0 "We must reform the state so that it is ready to face any obstacle unshaken."
 bul_bulgarian_succession_desc:0 "After the disastrous reign of Boris IV, his younger brother and heir Simeon I. inherited a nation on the brink of civil war. Only a compromise with the Slovak nobility could save the nation from certain collapse. This compromise however included a provision, that upon the death if Simeon, the Slovak nobles had a right to choose, if the union should continue. We must negotiate this crisis without losing vital territory to any of our opportunistic neighbors."
 bul_bohemian_borderlands_desc:0 "The Bohemian Electorate owns the borderlands to our northwest. A strong and prosperous kingdom known to engage in vile heresies, we should take action against them to prevent them from spreading to our lands."
 bul_regain_slavonia_desc:0 "The catastrophic reign of Boris IV. has not only cost us the territorial integrity on the North and the Dacian borderlands, but we also lost the vital territory of Slavonia in a war against the Empire. Now controlled by the Imperial Grand Duchy of Zagreb, Slavonia had to be regained, both to prevent the emergence of a strong and united Croatian state, firmly rooted to the Empire, but also to show the world, that we have regained control, and that Bulgaria will once again assert it's position as the foremost power in the Balkans and beyond."
 bul_weaken_austria_desc:0 "The Duchies of Austria and Styria have been weakened by centuries of Bohemian control. It is time that they both come under our influence, and we shall weaken Austria so that we can establish it as a buffer against attacks by our western neighbors."
 bul_duchy_of_austria_desc:0 "Vienna and Steyr would be fine additions to our [Root.GovernmentName] - as would the rest of the Austrian lands, as far as the Lake Constance. We should acquire them for ourselves."

 per_baluchistan_desc:0 "Balochestan straddles the border between Eran and India and has for centuries changed hands between powers from those regions regularly. Our conquest of the region would serve two purposes: establishing that the region is firmly Persian, and preparing us for an eventual incursion into the lands of India."
 per_indian_trade_desc:0 "With control of the endpoint of Indian and Spice Islands trade, our focus shifts to the origin of the goods traded in Hormuz."
 per_transoxiana_desc:0 "The land of the Turkmens, in between the Aral and Caspian seas is nearly inhospitable, a vast desert with few trading posts and oases. Nevertheless, control of this land is imperative if we are to protect against attacks from the hordes of the north."
 per_herat_desc:0 "The city of Herat has been called the Pearl of Khwarasan and sits at the crossroads of the Silk Road and lesser Perso-Khwarasani trade routes. As part of our push east, we should assert Persian control over this city."
 per_greece_desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors fought war after war against the Greeks; first against their city-states, then against their empires, then against their soldiers under the Romans. It is time once and for all to establish solid Persian control over the Greeks."
 per_egypt_desc:0 "Egypt is a rich land, and one of the cradles of civilization. The current rulers, however, are weak and pitiful. Let us show them true strength."
 per_oman_desc:0 "The Omanis rule over a paltry kingdom based around Indian Ocean trade. They must not be allowed to interfere with our dominance."

Of course, the mercantile implications of this are obvious; any nation in control of the Khyber Pass poses a serious risk to our trade with India. What's more, the important trading hub of Kabul lies not far from [2226.Owner.GetName]'s domain. We must secure control of the Khyber Pass, for our own sake and the sake of other similarly inclined nations."

However, the lands of Khwarasan are religiously diverse. Various sects of Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and even Sun worship are present in our lands and the lands near us. Out of necessity, the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]s established vassal states in Sakastan and Kabulistan. However, it is time that we centralize our realm, and revoke their vassalage."

 mng_imp_eco_desc:0 "If we are to truly call ourselves Emperors of China someday, we must make sure that our economy can sustain our army, navy, and bureaucracy. If we cannot manage this, then the Mongol Menace will get the last laugh."
 mng_great_wall_desc:0 "The Great Wall was used for centuries by the dynasties of past to keep the Jurchen and Mongol hordes out of China. Clearly, that didn't work well enough when Genghis Khan marched around it. If we are to prevent a Mongol resurgence or, potentially, a Manchurian threat, we should rebuild the wall and expand its defenses."
 mng_south_china_desc:0 "With the conquest of Southern China, the region has been left devastated by warfare and religious conflicts over the past few decades. Along with this, as comes with any conquest the peoples of the south likely view us as conquerors rather than liberators. We should amend this by investing heavily in the South to revitalize the region's economy and quality of life."
 mng_eastern_trade_desc:0 "Once, all of the civilized courts in the world wished to trade with our merchants. Now, as the Europeans chart the world, that has begun to change. We cannot allow this, and must contest European trade in the east if we are to prevent ourselves from falling prey to Europe's deceitful ways."
 mng_modern_economy_desc:0 "Europe has established itself as one of the most culturally, technologically, and militarily powerful regions in the entire world, with some of their Empires spanning the entire globe. If we are to prevent ourselves from becoming prey to European interests, we must advance our economy further and expand on industry and the like."
 mng_formosa_desc:0 "The island of Formosa has been inhabited by barbarians for centuries, and unless we intervene it will remain so. The island is full of resources ripe for the taking, and if we don't take the island ourselves, someone else will."
 mng_amass_army_desc:0 "Our nation is surrounded by enemies on all sides, and if we are to survive this period of turmoil we must expand the army to be able to deal with any threat. After all, the Middle Kingdom has always been a land full of bodies to throw at the wall." 
 mng_defeat_wu_desc:0 "The Wu have been a right thorn in our spine ever since the Red Turban Rebellion began. Now, we have finally triumphed over them, and our coast is secure for the time being."
 mng_red_turbans_desc:0 "As our armies clash with those of the Mongols and their puppets, the Red Turbans hear our calls. With their help, our march to victory has already begun. Down with the Mongols!"
 mng_LOTR_reference_desc:0 "With the Mongol threat dealt with for the time being, we've managed to take control of the Shandong Peninsula and we have complete control of the mouth of the Yellow River, the same River which is home to the cradle of our civilization. As such, the peasants living there feel significantly safer and are able to work without the threat of Mongolian raiders pillaging their homes."
 mng_beijing_desc:0 "With the fall of Peking, any hopes of Mongolian dominance over the Middle Kingdom once again have been extinguished. Now, as we have liberated the Northern Capital, we may overthrow soon the Mongols and call ourselves the Emperors of China!"
 mng_religious_woes_desc:0 "The Middle Kingdom, with Christian preachers traveling along the Silk Road, has experienced decades of religious turmoil and conflict on a scale unimaginable a few centuries ago. A byproduct of this turbulence is a number of Christian and Pagan states asserting themselves in the west, whom are ripe for the taking and are the gateway to the south."
 mng_silk_road_desc:0 "The Silk Road has, for millennia, been a hub of trade and has resulted in economic prosperity for any who have even slight access to it. Although it is an easy path for Abrahamic preachers to enter the Middle Kingdom, we shoud absolutely take control of one of the main land routes and enjoy the benefits of it."
 mng_rams_desc:0 "Canton, the City of the Rams, is finally under our control. With this, we may begin working our way towards politically and economically dominating the smaller nations in the south and, potentially, expanding our influence into India."
 mng_yunnan_desc:0 "The Yunnan Mountains have always been an obstacle for any invading army, but that has not stopped us. Now that we have conquered the region, it is possible for our reach to extend into the Himalayas and Tibet."
 mng_tibet_desc:0 "Although protected by the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau has seen itself subject to Chinese rule under past dynasties. Tibet has now seen the same fate under our dynasty, and as such the path to the westernmost regions of china is now accessible."
 mng_moghulistan_desc:0 "The remnants of the Mongol tribes have finally been crushed, and as such the silk road is now a much safer place for our merchants. Along with this, our armies have learned that the harsh terrain of the Steppe isn't something to joke about."
 mng_nam_desc:0 "Viet nam, the gateway into Indochina, is now within our grasp. Not only can we begin to dominate the region, but our armies have learned valuable experience from the brutal conditions of the jungles."
 mng_look_east_desc:0 "After the liberation of the Northern Capital the gateway into Manchuria and Mongol has been left open. We should look into conquering these regions, to stamp out the threat of these barbaric raiders crossing into our lands and reversing everything we have accompished."
 mng_manchu_desc:0 "Manchuria is home to the Jurchen tribes, the same ones who have raided the lands of the Middle Kingdom and Joseon for time immemorial. Now that we have conquered the region, these barbaric hordes can begin their transition into civilized life under our guiding hand. More importantly, however, it has opened the gateway into the lands of our Korean friends."
 mng_mongols_desc:0 "The Mongolian hordes, once the proud rulers of all of the Middle Kingdom, have now been crushed under our boot. With their subjugation, the threat of barbaric raiders pillaging our lands is finally gone, and the mistake of the Song Dynasty has been amended."
 mng_joseon_desc:0 "The people of Korea have been subject to constant raids and conquest from Jurchen raiders and Mongolian Khans. Although admirable, this matters little to us."
 mng_japan_desc:0 "The Mongolian Khans tried and failed more than once to subjugate the islands of Japan, and as the true rulers of the Dragon Throne, we have done what they could not and established control over the southernmost islands in the archipelago."
 mng_religious_questions_desc:0 "The Middle Kingdom has been subject to turmoil from Arabahamic preachers and a new faith in the south for decades now. As the old ways begin to falter, we must decide - should we remain following a decadent faith, or should we change our ways if we are to not make the same mistake as the Mongols?"
 mng_affirm_religion_desc:0 "Now that we have decided our faith, we can work to begin mending the schisms in Chinese society and spread our faith to every corner of our growing empire. After all, we are a tolerant society, are we not?"
 mng_religious_unity_desc:0 "The question of religion in the Middle Kingdom has finally been settled, as our faith has emerged triumphant after years of conquest. It is clear now that our faith is to stay, and only another religious disaster could change that."

 yue_pacify_yuenan_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of North Vietnam has not been very helpful for our stability. They are a proud people, too unwilling to live under our rule. We need to accommodate them better to ease tensions."
 yue_hainan_strait_defenses_desc:0 "The strait that splits the mainland from the island of Hainan is key to the defense of our territories. Local fortifications will certainly improve its security."
 yue_deal_with_buddhists_desc:0 "Buddhism is one of the oldest faiths in the world, and their tendency to spread towards the Middle Kingdom from the West has been a thorn in the growth of our worship. A solution is necessary."
 yue_deal_with_christians_desc:0 "Christians are a new force in our lands, growing from lands far to the west, bringing in new ideas whose influence we seriously underestimated. We need to be a bit more decisive about managing them."
 yue_western_banditry_desc:0 "Bandits plague any area remotely difficult to traverse in all of the Middle Kingdom, specially in times of trouble. Most warlords fail to quell banditry within their own lands, some even preferring to work with the bandits. This is unacceptable for us; we'll kick them out of the jungles of Guangxi."
 yue_protect_the_south_desc:0 "The prefectures of the Yungui region are very easily defensible from the north and east, due to the mountains covering it's south and west. For the great emperors of the past, controlling it meant a peaceful border with all of the Thai and Burmese invaders. Unfortunately, the people living in there can be quite rebellious. Either way, it's in our best interest to control the passes."
 yue_enter_sichuan_desc:0 "The Sichuan Valley is a main population hub, quite distant from the other ones. This is due to the fertility inside its laughably easy to defend borders, full of mountains all around it. A dreamy homeland, to be sure - the Shu have had it as a powerbase for a while. We've got plenty reasons to want to own it..."
 yue_venture_hexi_corridor_desc:0 "The strip of (some) fertility amid arid deserts and large mountains is the best passage between the North and the rest of Central Asia. Needless to say, the amount of goods that funnel there rather than take a trip through the desert is simply unprecedented. Once taken, most of the world's silk will pass through us."
 yue_our_share_desc:0 "As we thrive on trade, our necessity to control it's flux is what drives us to further expansion. In order to maximize our profits in the Chinese trade, we need to take a more aggressive approach."

 yue_southern_port_desc:0 "The ports of Guangdong province are in need of some updates; while they receive a lot of trade, warships didn't use to be common visitors in the Yuan dynasty. Now that we're no longer under Yuan control, we need a war navy, and to have a war navy, we need equipped ports."
 yue_south_china_sea_desc:0 "Our sailors are experienced in, well, sailing. What they lack is training as soldiers to engage in combat against other navies. We can't blame them for being peaceful, but peaceful is not what we need right now."

Our very deities' messages are not too dissimilar from those of the great philosopher. Yet, we need to enlighten our old kinsmen a little better about our point of view."
 yue_deal_with_tengris_desc:0 "We have a lot of grudges with the Yuan dynasty, and have a lot of bad things to say about it, but we cannot say they were zealous and intolerant. Despite how different they were, they embraced the many cultures and faiths of our lands well. Now they are gone, the Tengri remnants in our lands' faith is for us to decide. Should we reciprocate?"
