 #Descriptions

 lus_conquer_galicia_desc:0 "Up north lies a land with peoples that share many of our customs and a similar language. The time has come to integrate them."
 lus_naval_comms_desc:0 "Since our conquest of Macaronesia, we've been lacking an appropriately sized navy to communicate with the settlers there. We should rectify that."
 lus_exploration_bases_desc:0 "Now that we estabilished appropriate connections between our homeland and our colonies, we should build up one of the islands to have a fair-sized town for a naval base."
 lus_discover_america_desc:0 "It's time we set sail westwards and look for new land, be it islands or an entirely new continent."
 lus_colonial_endeavors_desc:0 "We have succesfully discovered a whole new world! We must secure a foothold there for the glory of Lusitania!"
 lus_wood_and_dyes_desc:0 "Down south lies a large jungle with a unique tree with a shade of red in it's trunk. Nod only is the wood of high quality, but it also provides us with a ember-like dye. We shall name it after it's ember-like color - 'Pau-Brasil'."
 lus_inca_desc:0 "Reports indicate a fully settled civilization lives in the mountains on the other side of the New World. Even without horses, they have large roads sprawling through the mountains. And, more importantly, silver. Lots of it. Let's take it all!"
 lus_mastery_of_coins_desc:0 "If we succesfully control both the gold from Mexico and silver from Peru, we will have a steady supply of coverage for our currency! We will be able to master inflation and bend markets to our will!"
 lus_foothold_desc:0 "We can initiate operations to take over territories in Africa, much like the Berbers once did in Iberia, if we manage to secure a port."
 lus_northern_morocco_desc:0 "The strait of Gades is too strategically important to not be in our hands. Let us take all of the Mauretanian coast!"
 lus_monopolize_atlantic_desc:0 "The Mauretanians have been tested by us, and they were weak. It's time we remove their access to the coast - we don't need to penetrate inland to penetrate their markets."
 lus_close_mediterranean_desc:0 "Controlling both sides of the Straits of Gades will allow us to block entrance and exit for merchants from other nations!"
 lus_sweet_sugar_desc:0 "The Caraíbas seem to have all of the perfect characteristics to produce sugar in a large scale, even more so than the Macaronesian islands! We must not let this opportunity pass!"
 lus_mexico_desc:0 "The warrior peoples of the so-called 'Mexico' built a massive city in the center of a lake during their breaks from making human sacrifices. It looks pretty, therefore we should take it for ourselves."
 lus_build_up_army_desc:0 "Iberia is a powder keg. We cannot show weakness, let us levy our men and prepare ourselves for an inevitable war that is coming along."
 lus_leon_desc:0 "The lands of the crown of Leão are quite wealthy and will serve to expand our influence in Iberia. It is decidly the next step in our conquests."
 lus_battle_for_badajoz_desc:0 "Badajoz and Hispális have long been a goal for Lusitanian leaders. Their wealth is massive and a good chunk of the money that comes in and out of Iberia comes from there."
 lus_crush_cartagena_desc:0 "Cartagena's aggressive and militaristic behavior cannot be tolerated. We must strike before they do to ensure a safe border."
 lus_other_side_desc:0 "Across the peninsula stands Valência, proudly. A large city for those with large ambitions, taking control of it will safeguard the eastern entrepot of Iberia."
 lus_block_others_desc:0 "At this point, we should just annex the entire northern coast of Iberia to ensure permanent Lusitanian naval supremacy."
 lus_inland_endeavors_desc:0 "We have secured the ports. The inland crowns are deprived of their source of wealth. The time is ripe to push inland."
 lus_central_mountains_desc:0 "At the heart of Iberia, mountains make for a difficult obstacle for conquerors, but we believe we can safely lay siege to these inner territories and become the masters of the mountains ourselves."
 lus_iberia_unification_desc:0 "No one else stands in our way. We rule as the strongest nation in Iberia by far. We shall seal the fate of all those who remain opposing us!"
 lus_olisipo_desc:0 "Olisipo is a respectable city on it's own, but has lacked appropriate effort to expand it's wealth. With some resettling and investing, we will turn it into a metropolis the likes of Paris!"
 lus_vinho_do_porto_desc:0 "The wine from Porto is of the best quality. Perhaps we should invest more into it's production to ensure we have enough to sell to all those willing to buy this delicious drink."
 lus_southern_entrepot_desc:0 "Silves is very strategically positioned. Unfortunately, it's size does not match our expectations, let alone our needs. We must build up infrastructure for it to become the next great center of Iberian wealth."
 lus_aragon_desc:0 "A mountainous duchy that separates us from the western coast, Aragão is yet another barrier for us to overcome."
 lus_naval_comms_tt:0 "Have a fleet of at least §Y25§! ships."

 per_khorasan_desc:0 "Khorasan is the gateway to the East, and contains the great fire temple of Sabzevar, Azarburzin. For these reasons, control of Khorasan directly or indirectly is prudent."
 per_caspian_coast_desc:0 "The Caspian is the largest inland sea in the known world, and a hub for trade in the Near East. More of its coastline under our control would serve as a commercial stimulant."
 per_religious_unity_desc:0 "Our nations has faced challenge after challenge, many centered around the religions of our people. However, with the Nestorian Rebellion at an end, we can safely say that we are unified in faith."
 per_places_of_worship_desc:0 "Truly we are devout; this has been the case for as long as our empire has existed. We must show our devotion by constructing temples for our people."
 per_persian_trade_desc:0 "The marketplaces of the south shore of the Caspian Sea receive traders from as far east as China. A monopoly on the trade here would certainly boost our economy."

 per_anatolia_desc:0 "Asia Minor, ancient site of the kingdom of Lydia and the satrapy of Sparda, has fallen into the hands of other powers, pretenders to the Lydian throne. We must reassert Persian control!"
 per_caucasus_desc:0 "The ancient kingdom of Armenia served as a vassal to our ancestors, the Parthians. Now, however, the region is divided between nomadic hordes and decentralized kingdoms. There needs to be a strong ruler on the Armenian throne; a ruler that, naturally, must be Persian."
 per_palestine_desc:0 "Since the days of the Achaemenids the Nile has been ruled not by a Persian, but by another power, native or otherwise. Conquest of Egypt as of now is not attainable; however, preparations are in order."
 per_baluchistan_desc:0 "Balochestan straddles the border between Eran and India and has for centuries changed hands between powers from those regions regularly. Our conquest of the region would serve two purposes: establishing that the region is firmly Persian, and preparing us for an eventual incursion into the lands of India."
 per_indian_trade_desc:0 "With control of the endpoint of Indian and Spice Islands trade, our focus shifts to the origin of the goods traded in Hormuz."
 per_transoxiana_desc:0 "The land of the Turkmens, inbetween the Aral and Caspian seas is nearly inhospitable, a vast desert with few trading posts and oases. Nevertheless, control of this land is imperative if we are to protect against attacks from the hordes of the north."

However, the lands of Khorasan are religiously diverse. Various sects of Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and even Sun worship are present in our lands and the lands near us.
