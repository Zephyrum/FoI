Who originally commissioned it, has been lost to time, but it was restored in the 11th century by the illustrious Abisalom, 3rd king of the new Memfi dynasty, as a symbol of his commitment to advancing the realm of science and unraveling the secrets of the cosmos. Guided by the genius of Georgios Mosaraph, an esteemed Aigyptiote polymath and astronomer, the observatory became a haven for scholars from far and wide. However, the ravages of time and the ebb and flow of empires conspired to cast a shadow over this beacon of knowledge. Neglect and conflict marred its once-majestic halls, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. But fret not, for our enlightened reign shall herald a renaissance for the Thebes Observatory. Under our guidance, the observatory will be meticulously restored to its former grandeur. Walls once worn by centuries of neglect shall be repaired, and the celestial instruments that once guided the gaze of scholars shall be revived. A select group of astronomers, mathematicians, and cartographers will be invited from across our realm to revive the spirit of inquiry that once thrived within these walls. The restored Thebes Observatory shall serve as a center of astronomical research and intellectual discourse, attracting brilliant minds from far and wide. Our kingdom will bask in the glory of their discoveries, as they unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and illuminate the darkest corners of the night sky. The knowledge gleaned within these halls shall not only enrich our realm's scientific pursuits but also strengthen our position as patrons of learning and enlightenment."

And while our nation thrived, the Jalayirids had to stoop so low, as to grant self rule to the Mesopotamians, a region that has not governed itself since antiquity! So it was only out of pity and mercy, when we overthrew the corrupt, weak and outdated Mongol dynasty, and took control over the carcass of what was once a mighty empire. But adding this much land to our nation comes with risks. While Mesopotamia should be ruled directly no matter what, Syria and Assyria can be granted autonomy - for now - to appease our new subjects, so we may slowly integrate them into our nation. We only have to determine how much self rule is too much."
