With the integration of this sect into the main branch has come an influx of new ideas and concepts. In particular a philosophy called Ruism. Codified in the five classics and four books, it covers a range of laws and ethics which draws upon the history of the Zhou dynasty, one of the greatest kingdoms in the history of Asia. Our Chinese compatriots speak fondly of it and how they use it in addition to the Avesta. But following them, would make us subject to the laws of China, and strict rules of handling international affairs will likely hamper our growth. So,it is not surprising, that some argue, while the ideas might be a worthy addition to our faith, we can always choose follow those laws later on, but in the mean time, spread the Khurmazta religion far and wide, and all over China, through more - let's say - traditional means..."

Turks and the Pashtuns demand that one of them be named superior over the other by the announcements of a supreme Tarkhan. Whoever we choose, this will certainly anger the other faction so completly, they will surely never support us again. Loosing on integral part of the army will weaken our nation, but can also be a chance for rethinking our whole miltary structure. But there is a third way. There are some in our court, who, after years of intermingling in our nation, belong to both the Turkic and Pashtun faction in equal terms. If we name one of them supreme Tarkhan, neither faction will particularly happy, but they can hardly complain, as it is still one of their's. Luckily family ties are so strong in both minorities.
