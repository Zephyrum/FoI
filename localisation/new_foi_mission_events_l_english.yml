How to deal with this development is subject of much discussion. Some, espescially the clergy want to see them all executed as heretics, some, under the lead of the merchants guild, want to join this new faith, and a third faction of nobles, burghers and farmers argues, that it may be time for a change, but we should rather return to the teachings of the cathars, who already had a presece in Occitania once, and not join some modern shortlived fashion."
