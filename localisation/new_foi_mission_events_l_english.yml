 foi_flavor_tou.1.desc:0 "For some time now, there is a new faith spreading. Man who wander around, nailing their theses on chruch portals, and proclaim the seperation from the Pope. How to deal with this development is subject of much discussion. Some, espescially the clergy want to see them all executed as heretics, some, under the lead of the merchants guild, want to join this new faith, and a third faction of nobles, burghers and farmers argues, that it may be time for a change, but we should rather return to the teachings of the cathars, who already had a presece in Occitania once, and not join some modern shortlived fashion."
 foi_flavor_tou.1.a:0 "Clearly we stay loyal to the pope!"

 foi_flavor_tou.2.desc:0 "Since the last days of the kingdom of Arles, is the question, if Dauphine is part of the Holy Roman Empire, more than disputed. The emperors often meddle in our affairs, und we get nothing in return, but we are powerless against them. That mustn't continue. To accept a German overlord, is out of the question./nAn envoy from Toulouse found his way to us a few days ago, and he made an offer, that we hardly can ignore: Dauphine will formaly become part of the Occitan Crown, and in return Toulouse offers protection against further meddling by the empire. We would finally be free of those good-for-nothing German emperors."

 foi_flavor_tou.4.desc:0 "In the times of the cursades, the king of Toulouse leased the bishopric of Avignon to the Holy See. The city should serve as an observation post, so the cursaders, setting sail from the southern French ports to the Barbarie, would respect the rules of hospitality, and not start plundering and killing while still in Europe. The pope also wanted to keep an eye on the growing cathar movement, in their Pyrenean mountain forts. Both Crusades and Cathars are long gone, and now the crown of Toulouse reclaims their property."

In the past centuries our state apparatus changed significantly, and that's why we should first try to align them again. In the meantime, the bishop should have some independence."
 foi_flavor_tou.5.desc.b:0 "We have been insulted and betrayed. They argue or claims are to old to be valid. We will let them pay for this betrayal. Avignon is and shall remain part of the Occitan crown, and we will crush everybody, who denyes us our birthright!"
