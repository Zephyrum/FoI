 foi_levantine_cav_5:0 "Qizilbash Cavalry"
 foi_levantine_cav_5DESCR:0 "Cavalry units made up of Zoroastrian Turkmen mercenaries, armed with spear, sword or bow, easily recognized by their red and gold striped headgear. Their move westward and arrival on the battlefields of Greater Persia and Mesopotamia during the early 16th century had a profound impact on the cavalry tactics of the region."

 #Egyptian Units

 #Infantry
 foi_egyptian_inf_1:0 "Nilotic Vanguard"
 foi_egyptian_inf_1DESCR:0 "During the Turkic invasions, much of the main army was scattered, so the Pharao had to rely on vanguard units, who, even though they were highly mobile, would traditionally only see combat in hit-and-run raids of the enemy supply lines."
 foi_egyptian_inf_2:0 "Delta Militia"
 foi_egyptian_inf_2DESCR:0 "Raised from the local self defense units of townships and smaller cities that developed during the Turkic invasions, these poorly armed and trained infantry were never of much use in combat, but helped to significantly bolster the ranks of the depleted Egyptian army."
 foi_egyptian_inf_3:0 "Reformed Sarissa Infantry"
 foi_egyptian_inf_3DESCR:0 "When the Goths defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople, it heralded a new era in Mediterranean warfare. Cavalry became the dominant force on the battlefield, and infantry was relegated to serve as a base for cavalry to maneuver around. However, the success of the Swiss pikemen of the late 15th century gave infantry an offensive role once again. This was quickly noticed by Egypt, leading to the development of the Sarissa Infantry, their name invoking the spirit of the phalanxes of old, like used by the Macedonians to conquer Egypt."
 foi_egyptian_inf_4:0 "Defensive Egyptian Musketeers"
 foi_egyptian_inf_4DESCR:0 "With the spread of gunpowder weapons, soon the question of what musket armed infantry should do on the battlefield was raised. In Egypt, a school of thought that argued musketeers should be used as a defensive weapon to support cavalry was developed."
 foi_egyptian_inf_5:0 "Nilotic Tercio"
 foi_egyptian_inf_5DESCR:0 "Although the tercio came to dominate European battlefields it was initially too slow to be of use on the more open, cavalry dominated desert battlefields of Upper Egypt. However, as the pike component of the tercio fell, giving it more firepower, it became more useful on the southern battlefields."
 foi_egyptian_inf_6:0 "Matai Infantry"
 foi_egyptian_inf_6DESCR:0 "Stemming from the Phiom Oasis, these soldiers were renowned for their ability to never break formation despite enemy volleys and countering even the worst of assaults. Over time, it became customary to position them in the center. It is said that as long as at least one Matai stands, the army can still win, even against all odds."
 foi_egyptian_inf_7:0 "Memphian Guard"
 foi_egyptian_inf_7DESCR:0 "The Memphian guard traces their roots back to the personal guard of Dio V. Seeing that a good portion of the army had become too reliant on numerical superiority while drill and tactics had been neglected, he introduced the techniques developed by his personal guard and the Matai to the whole military. Trained with iron discipline, the Memphian Guard excelled in defense. Their tactics were built around wearing down the enemies' ability to fight through sheer staying power."
 foi_egyptian_inf_8:0 "Amber Coat Infantry"
 foi_egyptian_inf_8DESCR:0 "As more military ideas were imported from Western Europe, the Egyptian infantrymen became much more like their European counterparts. The Amber Coat infantry was developed with the help of French and Czech military advisors, and its western training methods and equipment gave their units more staying power in combat than ever before. Their amber colored uniform gave them a considerable stealth advantage on desert campaigns, hiding their true numbers and making the army look smaller, giving the enemy a nasty surprise."
 foi_egyptian_inf_9:0 "Egyptian Mass Infantry"
 foi_egyptian_inf_9DESCR:0 "Mass Infantry tactics were a departure from the linear tactics that had been dominant for so long. Invented by the Russians and introduced to Egypt by the Muscovite general and fugitive Alexei Dragunov, these units can be summed up in two of the maxims of the famous Russian general Suvorov: 'train hard, fight easy' and 'the bullet is a fool, the bayonet is a fine chap'. They were highly drilled shock infantry who favored the mass charge over musket fire."

 foi_egyptian_cav_1:0 "Nilotic Raiders"
 foi_egyptian_cav_1DESCR:0 "Bands of independent cavalry units, living on the edge of the desert, often hired to defend the Nile valley from bandits lurking in the desert, and used as regular units during war time."
 foi_egyptian_cav_2:0 "Stratioti Cavalry"
 foi_egyptian_cav_2DESCR:0 "The Stratioti developed in the Albanian-Greek areas of the Balkan. With little or no armor, they were armed with sabers, lances and maces. This light cavalry was excellent for screening, reconnaissance and for raiding into disarrayed or fleeing enemies. With the Byzantine civil war, many of those who fought on the losing side, sought refuge in the west, but some ended up standed in Anatolia, and found new masters in the Egyptian Pharaos. There their modern light cavalry techniques mixed with the traditional Arabian and Nilotic cavalry techniques during the late 15th century."
 foi_egyptian_cav_3:0 "Turkic Sepahi"
 foi_egyptian_cav_3DESCR:0 "After the destruction of the Aq Qoyunlu at the third battle of Memphis, many bands of Turkic cavalry roamed the Egyptian countryside as leaderless marauders. The Pharaos dealt with them, by giving them depopulated land to settle in exchange of military service. So the Egyptian Sepahis were born, and soon became a valuable asset in the Pharao's armies."
 foi_egyptian_cav_4:0 "Arabian Flankers"
 foi_egyptian_cav_4DESCR:0 "A force of highly mobile, mixed camel and traditional cavalry from Arabia, feared for their ability to seemingly appear out of thin air on the enemies flanks, smashing into their lines, often completely routing them in the process."
 foi_egyptian_cav_5:0 "Reformed Nilotic Sepahi"
 foi_egyptian_cav_5DESCR:0 "While the Turkic language and culture dwindled in Egypt towards the end of the 17th century, the usage of Sepahi cavalry in the Egyptian army persevered, and even thrived. During the reign of Dios VI. they were crucial in his campaigns against Ethiopia and the tribes of the Nubian Corridor."
 foi_egyptian_cav_6:0 "Nubian Lancers"
 foi_egyptian_cav_6DESCR:0 "The cavalry units of southern Egypt have favored the lance since it's introduction by the Sepahi centuries prior. The lance was a powerful weapon in the attack, allowing a trooper to reach his enemy before the enemy could reach him, however, once the enemy managed to get passed the lance the lancer was vulnerable. Lance equipped cavalry were very strong in the attack but weak defensively."
 foi_egyptian_cav_7:0 "Southern Cuirassiers"
 foi_egyptian_cav_7DESCR:0 "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."

 #Persian Units

 #Infantry
 foi_persia_inf_1:0 "Iranian Archers"
 foi_persia_inf_1DESCR:0 "The Iranian Archers were light infantry units employed as archers, whose main directive it was, to break enemy cavalry formations."
 foi_persia_inf_2:0 "Khwarasani Footsoldier"
 foi_persia_inf_2DESCR:0 "The Khwarasani Footsoldier was mounted infantry favored by the Kartids. The extra speed it gave them, would make sure they always had the choice of battlefield. They would ride up as close as possible to the opposing army, dismount, and face the enemy on foot."
 foi_persia_inf_3:0 "Shamsher Infantry"
 foi_persia_inf_3DESCR:0 "Infantry equipped with slim bladed, heavily curved, one-handed swords. Most effective against infantry or cavalry wearing no armor."
 foi_persia_inf_4:0 "Armenian Musketeers"
 foi_persia_inf_4DESCR:0 "With the growing spread of gunpowder weapons, soon the question of what musket armed infantry should do on the battlefield was raised. The first in the region who really made firearms their own were the Armenians, who soon became the most desired mercenaries on the Persian Plateau."
 foi_persia_inf_5:0 "Afsharid Reformed Infantry"
 foi_persia_inf_5DESCR:0 "Infantry troops armed with muskets during the reign of Naveed Shah. He was considered by some to be one of Persia's most able military leaders."
 foi_persia_inf_6:0 "Reformed Armenian Musketeers"
 foi_persia_inf_6DESCR:0 "Even with the age of the Musket slowly coming to it's end, the Armenian Musketeers still were some of the best infantry units in Greater Persia. To be effective on the eastern Steppes, infantry continued to create mobile forts on the battlefields from which lighter muskets and cannon could be brought to bear on the enemy without the risk of cavalry charges from the lighter steppe cavalry breaking their formations."
 foi_persia_inf_7:0 "Persian Rifles"
 foi_persia_inf_7DESCR:0 "The Persians were the first Asian military to adopt the rifle into their arsenal, and they did so enthusiastically. Their better accuracy suited the Iranian military doctrine, which favored quality over quantity."
 foi_persia_inf_8:0 "Westernized Persian Rifles"
 foi_persia_inf_8DESCR:0 "By the end of the 18th century the Persian armies had in many ways gone through similar transitions as militaries to the West. While cavalry would still have a heavier influence, equipment and organization evolved to be more like standing armies. As more and more accurate rifles were developed in Persia, which came to dominate the battlefields of Central Asia, tactics developed in this period would continue to be employed regularly into the 19th century."

 #Cavalry
 foi_persia_cav_1:0 "Kartid Raiders"
 foi_persia_cav_1DESCR:0 "A cavalry unit most often relying on indirect military tactics, harassing and raiding its enemies."
 foi_persia_cav_2:0 "Tokhtamyshid Cavalry"
 foi_persia_cav_2DESCR:0 "Although they would make an early entry to firearm tactics, guns were slow to make a large difference on the steppes due to the mobile nature of warfare in the region. Cavalry would continue to be the dominant part of the steppe armies throughout the early modern era before firearms were made lighter and more accurate. Knives and swords would long remain the weapon of choice in close combat for steppe infantry."
 foi_persia_cav_3:0 "Qizilbash Cavalry"
 foi_persia_cav_3DESCR:0 "Cavalry units made up of Zoroastrian Turkmen mercenaries, armed with spear, sword or bow, easily recognized by their red and gold striped headgear. Their move westward and arrival on the battlefields of Greater Persia and Mesopotamia during the early 16th century had a profound impact on the cavalry tactics of the region."
 foi_persia_cav_4:0 "Heavy Iranian Lancers"
 foi_persia_cav_4DESCR:0 "To counter devastating effect the Qizilbash cavalry had, the Iranian cavalry became heavier and overall more defensive. The Iranian Lancers used the extra bulk their armor gave them to slam into enemy units, and inflict heavy damage."
 foi_persia_cav_5:0 "Afsharid Reformed Cavalry"
 foi_persia_cav_5DESCR:0 "Camel cavalry armed with muskets during the reign of Naveed Shah. He was considered by some to be one of Persia's most able military leaders."
 foi_persia_cav_6:0 "Sogdian Heavy Hussars"
 foi_persia_cav_6DESCR:0 "The Sogdian Heavy Hussars were a marriage of Iranian and Russian influences, combining the bulk of Persian cavalry with the more mobile Eastern European Hussars, and were far more maneuverable than the heavily armored lancers previously employed."
 foi_persia_cav_7:0 "Heavy Persian Dragoon"
 foi_persia_cav_7DESCR:0 "In the 17th century, the new European type of cavalry called Dragoons found it's way to Persia. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. In contrary to it's European counterpart, the Persian Dragoons were always also used as traditional cavalry and to this end kept a minimum of armor."

 foi_barbarie_inf_1DESCR:0 "Infantry units equipped with axe-headed poles with pikes. Halberds came into regular use during the 14th and 15th century and were mainly developed to combat heavily armored troops more effectively."
 foi_barbarie_inf_2:0 "Outremer Footsoldier"
 foi_barbarie_inf_2DESCR:0 "Inspired by the more heavily armored Crusaders, the Berbers began to adopt heavier armor themselves during the late 15th century."
 foi_barbarie_inf_3:0 "Early Mauritanian Tercio"
 foi_barbarie_inf_3DESCR:0 "The Mauritanians began to adopt the Iberian developed tactics of the Tercio early on. This mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers with it's combined-arms approach, gave the formation both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation."
 foi_barbarie_inf_4:0 "Garamantian Free Shooter"
 foi_barbarie_inf_4DESCR:0 "The development of better firearms forced a change in tactics for the Garamantian Infantry. These hardy warriors would now await the first volley from the enemy and then unleash their irresistible charge. A tactic similar to the one developed by the Irish and Scottish."
 foi_barbarie_inf_5:0 "Remodeled Maurician Infantry"
 foi_barbarie_inf_5DESCR:0 "In the 16th century, the musket (a handheld firearm) became commonplace, but they were very slow to reload. Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 16th century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Maurice of Nassau who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Dutch troops in the Eighty Years' War. His development of military strategy and spread to Northern Africa through Mauritanian mercenaries employed by the Lusitanians, and were adopted to fit the battlefields of the Barbarie."
 foi_barbarie_inf_6:0 "Reformed Mauritanian Tercio"
 foi_barbarie_inf_6DESCR:0 "The Tercio, or Toledan Square, was a mixed formation of pikemen and musketeers developed by the Toledan General Gonzalo Fernandez de Tolosa. The victory of the Toledan armies at Roussillon (1525) would lead to its domination of the European battlefield for 100 years. The early Tercios contained anywhere from 50-70% pikemen. However, the Tercio were still evolving and through experimentation it was found that the number of pikemen required could be reduced. These late tercios could have as little as 25% pikemen leading to a massive increase in the formations' firepower, with the Mauritanian variant going even lower, as during that time period the Mauritanian army mostly operated in ragged terrain of the Atlas mountains, where the musket's range was more important than melee combat."
 foi_barbarie_inf_7:0 "Kabylian Retraiteurs"
 foi_barbarie_inf_7DESCR:0 "While most armies during the turn of the 18th century preferred mass volleys and subsequent charges from a small distance, the provincial Governor of Kabylia, Teodor n Villahermosa found a way to counter that tactic. His drilled his army be able to walk backwards while reloading, not allowing his enemy to close the gap within 2 volleys before their charge. This tactic was highly dangerous, and failed more often than it succeeded, but could seriously confuse overconfident enemies."
 foi_barbarie_inf_8:0 "Azure Coat Infantry"
 foi_barbarie_inf_8DESCR:0 "The elite troops of the Mauritanian king Tomás n Mendoza. These troops are ruthlessly drilled to never falter and favor the defense over the offense"
 foi_barbarie_inf_9:0 "Tuareg Infantry"
 foi_barbarie_inf_9DESCR:0 "During the the Wars of North African Unification, the eastern nations were no match against the onslaught of the Mauritanian army. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units from the military frontier in the southern desert were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed armies. The use of loose order Tuareg infantry, while not unheard of in North Africa, was first applied here on a larger scale. The Tuareg units, all experienced sharpshooters, were put forward as a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 foi_barbarie_inf_10:0 "Tripolitanian Grenadiers"
 foi_barbarie_inf_10DESCR:0 "An infantry assault unit originally equipped with grenades and most often deployed in sieges. During the 18th century the Grenadiers came to regard the bayonet as their preferred weapon of choice in favor of the grenades. The usage of Grenadiers meant a reduction of overall firepower in the North African armies, but this was made up for by the Grenadiers toughness and close combat abilities."

 #Cavalry
 foi_barbarie_cav_1:0 "Southern Medieval Knights"
 foi_barbarie_cav_1DESCR:0 "The medieval Knight originated in the Frankish kingdoms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Western Europe and later with the crusades to the Barbarie. It became an integral part of the feudal system, in which Knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 foi_barbarie_cav_2:0 "Early Numidian Pistolario"
 foi_barbarie_cav_2DESCR:0 "This cavalry unit unique to the Barbarie first appeared as skirmishers on the Numidian Plateau. They consisted mainly of former tribal Tuareg cavalry operating in small independent units, who switched their bows to several early wheellock pistols each. They would attack the enemy infantry, fire their pistols, and retreat to reload, and attack again, using the ragged terrain of the Barbarie to their advantage. They were known for wreaking havoc with enemy supply lines."
 foi_barbarie_cav_3:0 "Mauritanian Caracole Cavalry"
 foi_barbarie_cav_3DESCR:0 "In the late 16th and early 17th century the most common combat formation for western European cavalry was the Caracole, which via Iberia also found it's way into the Mauritanian military. The Caracole could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged frontally against the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 foi_barbarie_cav_4:0 "Reformed Charge Pistolario"
 foi_barbarie_cav_4DESCR:0 "The pistol armed Caracole Cavalry came to dominate cavalry tactics of the Barbarie, although the traditional shock action cavalry style was still in use, for example with the tribal saber units of the Garamantians. Armies trained in the European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the 2nd Garamantian War, the Mauritanian army developed a different kind of unit, the Reformed Charge Pistolario. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Crusene Coalition War, forcing the Southern Caracole cavalry to adapt very quickly."
 foi_barbarie_cav_5:0 "Southern Dragoons"
 foi_barbarie_cav_5DESCR:0 "In the 17th century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. Originating in Europe, Dragoons were soon widely used by all North African nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 foi_barbarie_cav_6:0 "Mauritanian Carabiners"
 foi_barbarie_cav_6DESCR:0 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiniers main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword. In the heat of the southern Barbarie their heavy armor was of some disadvantage, which hampered their offensive capabilities, but it also insured that they always were the units with the greatest defense on the field."
 foi_barbarie_cav_7:0 "Reformed Numidian Pistolario"
 foi_barbarie_cav_7DESCR:0 "In the 18th century the Pistolarios returned more to their traditional role as mounted cavalry units specialized in skirmishes and renowned for their shooting skills. In the employ of rebel leaders and the few remaining pockets of resistance against their rule, were a constant throne in the side of the Mauritanian empire."

 byzinfantry_1a:0 "Paramonai Infantry" #Greek guards
 byzinfantry_1aDESCR:0 "A subset of the army composed largely of Greeks and Arberian soldiers, the Paramonai is a native Greek formation dating back to the 1200s. Previously, these sword-wielding soldiers were tasked with guarding frontiers, castles and VIPs in small numbers. However, by the late Komnenoi era, they were greatly expanded to be one of the cores of the Byzantine army, due to being cheap and effective defenders."

 byzinfantry_5:0 "Allagion Infantry" #Standing army of the late empire
 byzinfantry_5DESCR:0 "A permanent infantry core, estabilished by the late Komnenoi in an attempt to maintain a reliable, non-mercenary army, much like the Paramonai, but with the logistics organization that would allow them to function while going on the offensive, the Allagia was not too different from the Paramonai in cost, but more versatile and willing to cross a border."

 byzinfantry_7:0 "Reorganized Allagion Infantry" #Fictional shit starts here; army standardization effort
 byzinfantry_7DESCR:0 "Following the Three Eagles' War and the temporary collapse of Imperial authority, armies were too small for all parties involved, so most had to make due with on-the-battlefield innovations. The introduction of proper standardization was one of such major reforms, defining, in excruciating detail, the specifications of spears and some armor components."

 byzinfantry_9:0 "Italiot Pikemen" #Western tech lead, spreads into Italy and then to Byzantium
 byzinfantry_9DESCR:0 "Advances in warfare in Western Europe have brought the concept of pike square formations into the armies of the Griko states in southern Italy, spreading into the Balkans and Anatolia soon after."

 byzinfantry_12:0 "Neophalanges" #Power spike arrives
 byzinfantry_12DESCR:0 "Pike-and-shot formations took much of Europe by storm. In Byzantium, it was no different; invoking from the ancient Greek phalanx formations, the Neophalanges were the region's comparative to the Iberian Terçios. Fully standing, this army was led by pikemen, covered by shield-bearers right behind them, and missile troopers on the back. The Byzantine variant originally relied on crossbows on parts of the formation rather than arquebusiers."

 byzinfantry_15:0 "Macedonian Musketeers" #At this point, Byzantines have the best unit in the game
 byzinfantry_15DESCR:0 "When the muskets first hit the battlefields of Europe, their weakness was quickly discovered in their slow reloading times. A solution to this issue was to line up musketeers in a queue, often six to twelve soldiers long, in which the one in the front would fire, then run to the end of the queue, while the next one would fire, rinse and repeat. In the East, this innovation was first implemented on Macedonian regiments of the Byzantine army before its success spread to the army as a whole."

 byzinfantry_19:0 "Reformed Macedonian Musketeers" #Based on Swedish infantry in the 30YW. Power lowers here
 byzinfantry_19DESCR:0 "With increased professionalization of the troops across the Byzantine Empire, as well as increased training, the armies eventually optimized the musketeer lines, by making it a three gunmen line, arranged in different poses to minimize time spent aiming. This could only be done with a disciplined and well-trained line."

 byzinfantry_23:0 "Excubitor Infantry" #Flintlocks
 byzinfantry_23DESCR:0 "The invention of flintlock mechanisms made the armies of Europe much more efficient, as it was faster to reload and less likely to misfire, all the while being cheaper. In the Byzantine Empire, their adoption is attached to the recreation of the Exkoubitoi infantry within the provinces around the Taurus mountains, a revived corps named after an ancient part of the ancient Byzantine tagma."

 byzinfantry_26:0 "Purple Coat Infantry" #That's when Europe starts getting a thing for color-coats
 byzinfantry_26DESCR:0 "As Constantinople's wealth increased again and silk trade and production was made more common, silken vests became popular in the East. Wearers came to realize that silk had protective capabilities and could slow down projectiles from most guns reliably enough to save the life. Eventually, the army took notice and created vests specifically aiming to protect rather than appear snazzy. Tied together to the period of uniform standardization in the battlefields, the purple once exclusive to the sitting Emperor came to be the color of the coat of the common soldier."

 byzinfantry_30:0 "Anatolian Squares" #Napoleonic age infantry
 byzinfantry_30DESCR:0 "The early nineteenth century brought bayonets to the European fields. Simultaneously, the hollow square formations made their first appearance in Western Europe. This setup was exceptional against cavalry-reliant armies, but vulnerable to heavy artillery; for the Byzantines, at the time focused on their Asian holdings, fighting enemies that used tried-and-true cavalry tactics, this formation was key for their dominance beyond Europe."

 byzcavalry_1DESCR:0 "Even during bankruptcy, the courts of Constantinople had small standing armies, reminiscent of the early Palaiologan era. But due to their terrible limitations in manpower, these regulars were usually placed in lead cavalry roles, rather than supporting infantry, which was usually left for levies and mercenaries."
 
 byzcavalry_6:0 "Stratioti Horsemen" #Greco-slavic horsemen, also present in Eastern group
 byzcavalry_6DESCR: "Lightly armored cavalry units, composed of Greek and Slavic soldiers. Typically assigned for screening and recon, but also often used for raiding, particularly against fleeing enemies. While not the flashiest, those efficient horsemen saw themselves so succesful that even the Venetians hired them from their Balkan holdings for usage in campaigns everywhere."
 
 byzcavalry_10:0 "Byzantine Hill Cavalry" #Not much to say here
 byzcavalry_10DESCR:0 "As both the Balkans and Anatolia have rough, hilly and mountainous terrains, the cavalry corps of the regions have grown a liking to ambush strategies and downhill charges. These hardy riders have shifted towards a slightly heavier, more defensive armor for more efficient ambushing."
 
 byzcavalry_14:0 "Anatolian Hussars" #Early hussars dominate eastern battlefields
 byzcavalry_14DESCR:0 "Hussar units, originally from Hungary, became widespread in the battlefields of Europe, from east to west, as their middle-weight armor granted them the protection they needed from the modern weaponry, while sustaining their fast mobility that was dominant in late middle ages tactics. An adaptation of the imperial cavalry to fit the Hussar style greatly improved it."
 
 byzcavalry_18:0 "Neo-Athanatoi Cavalry" #Greek 'Immortals', heavy cavalry has it's dawn once more
 byzcavalry_18DESCR:0 "While the age of cavalry raids is slowly fading away in favor of in-depth, drawn out battles with cavalry flanks, heavier armor was in demand for every succesful cavalry force. Restoring the late medieval Athanatoi cavalry's favor for bulkier armor, while adapting modern horsebreeding, weaponry and armor designs, turns out to give out impressive results."
 
 byzcavalry_22:0 "Phoenix Hussars" #Winged Hussars with a different wing design, superheavy cavalry
 byzcavalry_22DESCR:0 "The growing popularity of artillery weapons shows the sign of the changing times. Cavalry charges are one of the few avaiable counter-tactics for barrages. Super-heavy cavalry is necessary to lead those charges, else they falter to smaller guns held by infantry and pikes. An adaptation of the Polish winged hussars with a couple design oddities on the uniform proves ideal."
 
 byzcavalry_28:0 "Roman Dragoons" #Dragoon cavalry grows in popularity
 byzcavalry_28DESCR:0 "The rise of small blunderbusses allowed cavalry units to cause heavy losses on opponents they can reach. While the original dragoons were mounted infantry, and would dismount when engaging, they have slowly reformed into using swords and handguns."
