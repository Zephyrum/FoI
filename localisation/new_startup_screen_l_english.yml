 string_start_asturias:0 "As a less rich and populated northern provinces of §YIberia§! quickly disintegrated into a mosaic of small states, mostly were subjugated by §YCharlemagne§!. The first kingdom of §YAsturias§! was founded by a local aristocrat named §YPelayo§!. He and his son would carve themselves a small kingdom in the former province of §YCantabria§!. When §YCharlemagne§! decided to place Northern §YIberia§! under his rule, §YAlphonso I§!, descendant of §YPelayo§!, submitted willingly to the §YFrankish§! conqueror in exchange for control of the newborn marches in the name of the §YFranks§!. §YCharlemagne§! accepted and the small kingdom of §YAsturias§! saw a rapid expansion as a result.\n\nThe dynasty of §YPelayo§! would not survive long after the collapse of the §YFrankish Empire§! in 888. As the last king §YGarcia I§! died without an heir in 925, the kingdom would be divided peacefully between local aristocratic families and the nearby kingdom of §YWest Francia§!, slipping altogether into feudalism.\n\nThe small new kingdom of §YAsturias§!, now ruled by the §Yd'Oviedo§!, was one of them, and it's relative weakness compared to his neighbors forced the §Yd'Oviedo§! to develop a careful diplomatic approach and a strategic use of political marriages. §YPelayo d'Oviedo§! was the first Asturian ruler to achieve decisive success as the kingdom began to expand by marital unions with most of the other remnants.\n\nFanatic partisans of the status quo, the Asturian kingdom is in a precarious position, their support of §YGalicia§! and §YNavarra§! as efficient buffer states has already angered their §YLusitanian§! and §YToulousian§! neighbors, and even their victory over the §YCartagenans§! in §YCatalonia§! has only antagonized them further.\n\nNow, the §Yd'Oviedo§! have to manage four different crowns, with their own institutions and history, all the while being seen as a decadent state, unprepared to take the blade and defend itself. The lack of appropriate diplomatic activity from their current rulers certainly do not help their cause..."
 string_start_lusitania:0 "The latinized §YCeltiberians§! were the first to rise in open rebellion, as the trouble caused by the succession of the last §YVisigoth§! king, §YAgila II§!, divided the attention of the failing §YVisigoth§! authority. But it wasn't until the final collapse of any sort of central government that most of the former province of §YLusitania§! truly descended into chaos.\n\nAfter centuries of anarchy, the §YLusitanian§! lands are finally tied together for the first time in ages. Centuries after centuries of unyielding efforts by the §Yde Semprônia§! family has turned a fragile federation of semi-tribal in the backwaters of Europe into a new local powerhouse capable of standing against its rivals. The §YLusitanian§! society and people are ready to intervene and project their will beyond their borders.\n\nWhile the resurgent §YCartagenan§! state is the most likely to upset the status quo in the region, the §YLusitanian§! people have already begun to send their people overseas in hope of new futures and horizons. In the North lies the rightful Lusitanian land stolen by the pagan vikings ages ago, ripe for the taking, while the relations with §YToledo§! in the East have been stagnant and chilly. The ultimate question, though, is will it last?"
 string_start_toledo:0 "Compared to the rest of the peninsula, the stabilization and recovery of the southern part of §YIberia§! from the crisis of the 8th century was the fastest. The survival of most of the city network and urban society from classical §YRoman§! civilization has deeply influenced the destiny of §YSouth Iberia§!.\n\nDespite the creation of the §YBetic Confederation§! in 821, which assembled all the city-states into a single, decentralized entity, only the fear of conquest by the §YImwehheden Empire§! centuries later could start a wave of centralization of power into the hands of the founder and ancestor of the §Yde Toledo§! dynasty, deigned first \"Magister Militium\" of the confederation.\n\nThe collapse of the §YImwehhedens§! pushed the last Magister Militium into proclaiming himself as the first §YToledan§! king in 1369, against all the particularist traditions of the confederation. The ensuing civil war pushed a former §YImwehheden§! general-turned-mercenary captain to stage a second invasion of Iberia, only stopped by the rise of §YPedro de Toledo§! and his brilliant military mind.\n\nThe last §YBerber§! enclave of §YGades§! is likely to fall into §YToledan§! hands once again, but the world is moving around them. The §YLusitanians§! have taken the lead into foreign expeditions, and the rise of §YCartagena§! might create a tumultous situation that will reshape the peninsula."
 string_start_cartagena:0 "The ruling §YVisigothic§! aristocracy was the main victim of the complete disintegration of the §YVisigothic§! kingdom, with almost all of §YIberia§! falling out of their hands. What was left of the old barbarian aristocracy was holding out in the former centers of power of the ancient kingdom along the eastern coast, from which the roots of the §Yde Rocamora§! can be traced back. The last §YVisigothic§! king, §YAgila II§!, would go on to name the §YRocamora§! family as dukes of the province of §YCartaginensis§! in 721. As chaos quickly engulfed most of the province after his death and plunged the region into a pseudo-feudal society, the §YRocamoras§! managed to successfully maintain themselves only in the regional capital, §YCartagena§!, and it's immediate countryside.\n\nIt wouldn't be until 1245, and the great fear inspired by the §YImwehhedens§! in southern §YIberia§!, that the §YRocamora§! duke §YAlphonso the Great§! came into power. Gifted with great intelligence and limitless ambition, he was a natural leader. His martial experience and diplomatic cleverness created a momentum that he and his dynasty would use to reconquer the land granted to their ancestors. After the reconquest of most the original territory of the now decayed province of §YCartaginensis§!, the consecration of the dynasty would come with §YCarlos I§!, who crowned himself \"Rex Iberorum\" in 1324. The momentum was, however, broken in 1340, with the §YCatalonian§! disaster in a war against §YAsturias§!.\n\nThis blow to the §YRocamora§! reign made the country fall into civil war, during which most of the nobility, still dissatisfied with the rise of a new state who made them lose influence, decided to rebel. By 1444, the §YRocamoras§! have crushed the last bastion of rebellion a few decades ago and have emerged victorious in a struggle that have ruined most of the landed nobility and reinforced the power and position of the ruling dynasty, and the last decades were spent rebuilding and preparing their revenge."
 string_start_gen_iberia:0 "The fall of the §YVisigoth§! kingdom in the early VIII Century gave birth to turmoil and chaos in the §YIberian§! peninsula. Cultural particularism and unchecked ambition of local warlords led to a century-long period of political instability which destroyed most of the §YRoman§! institutions, partially recovered and perpetuated by the §YGermanic§! invaders.\n\n§YIberia§! has been, since the collapse of the §YFrankish Empire§!, mostly undisturbed. The collapse and failure to rebuild any kind of advanced state structure and institutions opened multiple centuries of relative isolation and lawless rule.\n\nDuring the last centuries however, men, families and dynasties from all over §YIberia§! have emerged and a few have risen over the others. From their ambitions have emerged four new powerhouses that have, finally, consolidated themselves into the new owners of the land. Whether towards each other or against the states neighboring the peninsula - perhaps even towards the Atlantic - their expansion will surely bring the §YIberian§! peninsula out of it's isolation and into a ever changing world."
 string_start_baleares: "After the §YVandal§! defeat at the hand of §YBelisarius§!, the §YBaleares§! have been under control by the §YEastern Romans§!, as one of the holdings taken alongside the great prize of §YCarthage§!. The islands would later be used as stepping stones to reach Iberia, where §YLiberius§! - around ninety years old at the time - came to land, conquering, through tactical brilliance and diplomatic maneuvering, a large portion of the eastern coast. Thus, the province of §YSpania§! was restored.\n\n§YSpania§! started out being a part of the greater §YExarchate of Africa§!, headed from §YCarthage§!, but that came to change. As a whole, the region was neglected, and was kept in Imperial control the same way it was conquered - through tactico-operational brilliance of the stationed governors and generals rather than a larger strategic plan. Without resources, there is only so much a foreign occupation force can do to keep hordes at bay. Slowly, the holdings of the province shrank, as the hinterlands, and, eventually, the cities, were lost. New §YIberian§! powers rose in the region, such as §YAsturias§! or §YCartagena§!.\n\nThe remains of the provincial government, now completely independent and detached from §YConstantinople§!, with a mix of §YGreco-Iberians§! composing it's population, aristocratic or otherwise, have managed to retain the §YBalearic Islands§! even through the §YCrusades§!, but now they face the threat of the powers of §YIberia§! desiring the major naval ports of §YMajorca§!. It's up to the §YSpanians§! - or, as the locals pejoratively call them, §Y"Grooks"§! - to find a way to retain their independence, and, perhaps, project outwards. If the dominos are properly arranged, perhaps they could restore the glory of the province of §YSpania§!, albeit independently?"
 string_start_foi_arabia: "The §YArabian Peninsula§! has been locked in massive sectarian conflicts for centuries at this point, suffering greatly from the lack of a single, appropriate succession to the §YProphet§!. In fact, his very succession has been a major point of contempt between the many sects of a highly divided §YIslam§!. The §YAlids§! managed to secure the peninsula, and hold it in a somewhat-centralized entity for several centuries, but their influence deroded quickly to both internal and external pressure. With many rulers of different sects taking control of different parts, never have any succesfully achieved influence on the likes of the early "§YOrthodox Caliphate§!".\n\nWhile §YArabia§! is largely free of the influence of the traditional great powers of the region - the §YEastern Romans§! and the §YPersians§! - political changes in the climate surrounding it, such as the rise of a new §YEgyptian§! dynasty and the §YAfsharid§! conquest of §YPersia§!, have put §YArabia§!, once more, not far from the epicenter of the world's drama - the §YMiddle East§!.\n\nWith sectarian conflicts unresolved, growing presence of some §YChristian§! branches and the §YJewish§! pirates of §YKindah§!, the peninsula remains as divided as ever, with the local leaders hardly achieving more than independence and regional influence. Whether the §YProphet§!'s words will finally be heard across the desert or his influence forgotten by foreign conquerors, it remains to be seen, but for now, with a fractured religion, the cries for §YJihad§! are a distant memory..."
 string_start_foi_persia: "§YPersia§! has been in chaos ever since the last §YRoman§!-§YPersian§! wars in the seventh century. The §YSassanian§! dynasty's fragile control slipped away in the war exhaustion and constant invasions from all directions, as well as a scheming nobility and ever growing religious tensions between §YZoroastrians§!, §YNestorians§! and §YManicheans§!. As strife ravaged both countryside and large cities, the §YSassanid§! royal family escaped to §YChina§!. They would eventually make their return to the region, however as a skeleton dynasty ruling over the §YTurkic§! steppes, rather than §YIran§! itself.\n\nWhen the §YSeljuq Turks§! and the §YMongol Empire§! attacked and swept the region, the old order officially saw it's end, and the retraction of the §YIlkhanate§! borders have given space for multiple rising states to grow into prominence. Now, the region is divided. The §YAfsharids§! succesfully managed to secure a powerbase in Tehran and expand from it, carving their own empire under their leader, §YNarsieh§!. His invasion of the §YDayubids§!, claimants to be a cadet branch of the §YSassanid§! dynasty, undid their many conquests and exiled them to §YTabarestan§!, after it long seeming like §YDayubids§! would unify the realm once more. The §YKartids§! still hold on to the lands of Khorasan, and §YAfghanistan§! has a fierce §YZunbil§! presence.\n\nAll of §YIran§! is ripe for the taking for whichever warlord manages to secure their borders and raise an army grand enough for the job. Whether it's one of the estabilished powerhouses or one of the weaker states orbiting the region, such as §YNahraya§! or perhaps the many entities in §YCentral Asia§!, a whole new order approaches the centerpiece of the wealthy §YSilk Road§!."
 string_start_foi_north_africa: "§YNorth Africa§! has been messy ever since the downfall of §YRome§! caused its capture by the §YVandals§!. Tenuously unified at first at the hands of the §YEastern Romans§!, this did not last - the infighting within the §YEmpire§!, the many local ethnicities and the rise of new entities such as §YEgypt§! and the §YImwehheden Empire§! destabilized it for good. The latter would spread far and wide the §YTadmunist§! branch of §YChristianity§!.\n\nThis did not go unnoticed, and, later, the §YPope§! himself declared §YTadmunism§! a heresy that needed to be erased from history, calling all §YCatholic§! men, from rulers to peasants, to put aside their own personal squabbles and have a chance at redemption on the eyes of §YGod§!, should they unite for once in their lives, starting a whole new type of war: §YCrusades§!.\n\nThe shouts of §Y"Deus Vult!"§! overdid the followers of §YTadmun§!'s considerable might. The coast of §YAfrica§! was partitioned between multiple states with a very large share of §YLatin§! and §YFrench§! influence, kickstarting a whole new era in the region. To top it off, in §YIberia§!, §YToledo§! successfully pushed back the invasions, kicking the §YBerbers§! back to the minuscule exclave of §YGades§!, and hungrily, the powers in the peninsula seek to establish their dominion over the locals.\n\nWhat is left of the great state carved by the §YImwehheden§! remains in §YMauretania§!, still a fierce regional power. §YCarthage§! is ruled by foreigners, who make a fair amount of wealth from it's great ports. The §YTemplar Order§! controls a line of cities along the coast, and a §YGreek§!-speaking, §YOrthodox§! state of §YCyrenaica§! preserves the traditions of the §YEastern Church§! in the region.\n\nNow, with §YEgypt§! and the §YTurkish§! horde of §YAq Qoyunlu§! fighting over control of the §YNile§!, and the §YIberians§! busy with each other, a small period of respite shines a sliver of hope on the rulers on the northern edge of the dark continent. If one of them rises above the rest and, against all odds, shields the region of foreign influence, they are in an excellent position to rise to the world stage."
 string_start_foi_yuan:0 "In a week, §YAdai Borjigin§! will have reached the 55th year of his life. His small and ever-shrinking inner circle of loyalists knows well enough that this is quite the age, specially so for one of a warrior background, and expect the mighty §YKhagan§! to eventually fall ill to the one test no human has ever passed - time. There's a problem, though, those who stand against him are also well aware of it. \n\nFor decades, the §YYuan§! has been slowly falling. Collapsing under it's own weight, it's territory too vast to ensure it's all in the hands of loyal, clean governors. Instead, disloyal and corrupt ones rise. Some build grand fortunes, some carve their own state that operates independently in all but name. The tale of the §YMongol§! conquests is now an old one, too long gone to remember the fine details of. And the greatest of the states born out of that legacy is quickly tearing itself apart. \n\n§YAdai§! has been the one §YEmperor§! that refused to let his legacy fade away. Confronting the warlords, building his loyalist circle, securing the help of other skilled men from his court in §YKhanbaliq§!. Yet he is too old to bear a new son, and his only heir suffers pressure from courtesans who want to "educate" him, attempted murders, signs of inbreeding and all-around frailness. \n\nThe rest of his small clique includes his wife (and cousin) §YBayarma§!, the loyalist governor of §YJin§!, §YTaoshui Cao§!, and his favored cavalry commander, §YQi Bing§!. The four year old prince, §YTaisun§!, is the key to the succession, and, by extension, the one that will bring upon the §YMiddle Kingdom§! the turning point - whether the §YYuan§! decisively falls or turns around and defeats it's foes."
 string_start_foi_yue:0 "The East is experience a phenomena it never saw itself experiencing - religious conflicts. The many teachers that build the philosophical apparatus of the great dynasties of §YChina§! and it's many satellites were just that - philosophical. Faith has hardly concerned the peoples of the §YMiddle Kingdom§!, for while there is plenty of variety in worship amongst regions, and different tales about mythical beings, never have those dictated much of a man's live beyond superstitiousness. But this is a thing of the past.\n\nMore proactive, universal faiths have long been created in the far West, to lands the §YMiddle Kingdom§! have identified as §YDaqin§!, where a civilization to match the §YHan§! has formed and thrived. These faiths have established rites for all to follow and constantly enter conflict with different faiths or, sometimes, simply different sects. The arrival of one of those sects, the §YNestorians§!, through the §YHexi Corridor§!, meant the creation of a theological landscape never before seen amongst the §YHan§!. The §YMongol§! control of both the §YMiddle Kingdom§! and the §YSilk Road§! meant that this spread was constantly accelerated, and for their harshness, the §YYuan§! dynasty didn't particularly give much thought about intervening in the common citizen's beliefs. \n\nNow, after a boom of a foreign faith with little to do with the §YChinese§!, many a man could not find comfort in knowing their neighbors might be turned away from the great spirits in favor of a single "§YGod§!", whose very existence is cryptic beyond belief. Thus, a cultural movement in the growingly rich delta of the §YPearl River§! has seen the rise of a competing faith - four spirits that have long been worshiped as the central deities, and a set of rites tailored by the §YHan§! for the §YHan§!. Not many thought of it seriously at first, seeing it as some odd bastardization of faith. Had the landscape of the region been any different, this would have been curbed here. \n\nBut history often relies on the small things. The §YYuan§! has been collapsing in the North, and the South is politically isolated from their masters (in name, at least) by a great warlord in §YNanjing§!. This disconnect has given free rein for all of the southern governors to do as they please, and the new faith - named the cult of the four symbols (§YSixiang§!) - has found itself adopted by the governor of §YGuangdong§!. Having had ascendancy of both local pagans and §YNestorians§!, the compromise was believed to be ideal for the young §YYuehan Yue§!, who would become the main patron and one of the main scholars of the faith. \n\nAs the §YYuan§! in §YBeijing§! dives head-first into a seemingly inevitable conflict with the §YMing§! in §YNanjing§!, the South has been described of seeing the meteoric rise of banditry and spread of the §YSixiang§! faith. Standing right at the center of those changes, the rapidly growing §YYue§! must prepare for the ever-expanding list of regional rivals' desire to put away the fires of their new religion, all the while keeping an eye out for the developments further North...."
 string_start_chinese_warlords:1 "It seems fate itself does not like to give the §YMiddle Kingdom§! - §YChina§! - a break. Ever since the early days of the §YHan§! people, it seems it's resting point is that of chaos, regional governors, and corrupt rulers. Great unifier after great unifier has come and gone, and yet it always seemed to collapse into multiple entities. Governors declare independence, barbarians invade, the region gets fractured. This time it's not different - the §YMongols§! of the §YYuan§! dynasty invaded and secured their place in history. And now, the very same §YMongols§! are fighting to keep what's left of their §YEmpire§! whole, as warlords stake their claims to their regions, if not the whole §YEmpire§!. \n\nWhat is new, though, in the insertion of many different faiths, coming from the West to seek to proselytize inside §YChinese§! borders. Many warlord's peasants have converted, some warlords followed suit, and the religion question seems to be moving towards being a major point of content in the upcoming warlord era. \n\nTo the North, the remains of the §YYuan§! are at the knife's edge, but still in control, with the loyalists of §YJin§! assisting them, and the §YQin§! taking the blunt of the religious drama. In the center, the §YZhu§! clan has secured their power base, one much greater than that of all the others, rivaling central authority, threatening the §YWu§! in §YJiangdong§!. The South is still full of smaller, pettier governors, the most notable one being the rising §YYue§!, having just engaged on converting to a new faith, as well as the §YMin§!, essentially ruled by a junta of military officers. \n\nThe sand castle might finally come crashing down as the §YKhagan§!, §YAdai§!, approaches his late years. Whether it is the court intrigue that is going to displace him, or an invasion from one of the rival warlords - or even if he is going to be displaced, to begin with - it's clear that stability is almost certainly not going to mark the next few decades."

Quite the contrary, it remains the most powerful state in the region by a large margin. The fierce naval power of the §YHindu§! rulers of §YJava§! have granted them victory after victory and a strong control over the archipelago. Yet, they've been seeing a slow decline caused by a general lack of administrative capacity to handle all of their conquests, a problem no entity in the region faced before, for none was quite as successful at conquering as the §YMajapahit§! were. \n\nIn the §YMalaccan Peninsula§!, petty states squabbling over the homelands of the long gone §YSrivijaya§! have hardened the locals to battle. A distant relative of the old §YSrivijayan§! rulers now controls most of the peninsula from §YMalacca§!, and a reunification seems inevitable. When it is finished, perhaps the only state in the region with the bite to face the §YMajapahit§! shall be created. \n\nAs the §YGreat Yuan§! collapses further North, most of the region is free of §YChinese§! influence, and little is in the way of the rulers of the islands from potential expeditions into the §YThai§! lands.

The §YMongol§! invasion of §YChina§! has put the region on the knife's edge, but it remained fairly untouched as the §YKhagans§! focused on building their state in the old §YMiddle Kingdom§! rather than further expansion in the South. The §YThai§!, §YKhmer§! and §YBurmese§! states can only feel the ripples from the slow collapse, while the direct neighbors and peoples previously conquered by the §YChinese§! have seen a lasting period of independence unlike any before. \n\nThe major exception lies in the §YViets§!. The region has been historically contested, with §YChinese§! states invading it every now and then. Surprisingly, it is the periods of stability and internal cohesion in §YChina§! that have been the safest for the locals, for when governors stop listening to central authority, the Southern ones have a tendency to invade, and this time is no exception. \n\nAs the §YSixiang§! reformation spread like a wildfire across §YChina§!, it could also be felt in §YVietnam§!, particularly the North. This gave the §YYue§! a good reason and local support to launch a swift conquest of the region. Following the fall of the capital of §YDai Viet§!, new states have been birthed further South. Meanwhile, in §YBurma§!, the old masters of the region, the §YPagan§! dynasty, have all but disappeared, leaving a power vacuum to be filled, thus far, by the §YAva Kingdom§!. \n\nSurrounded by disarray in §YIndia§! and §YChina§!, §YSoutheast Asia§! is in a general state of relative peace when compared to darker times, much like their neighbors to the South, in the vast archipelago that is §YIndonesia§!.
