 cdl_resist_china: "Resist the Middle Kingdom"
 cdl_resist_china_desc: "The people have resisted Chinese occupation for long, previously due to ethnicity and traditions, but now, in the name of the faith. Regardless, we will keep resisting!"

 shu_outpost_of_the_west: "Outpost of the West"
 shu_outpost_of_the_west_desc: "No city west of Chengdu, within the Middle Kingdom, is bigger than it. We control one of the major centers of trade and influence of western China, that also serves as the border with other Christian nations."
 shu_pacification_of_nanzhong: "Pacification of Nanzhong"
 shu_pacification_of_nanzhong_desc: "South of us lays a province that has been a particularly rebellious throughout history. Controlled by barbarians that only recently became civilized (sort of), it has fought fiercely for it's independence in the past. The integration of the province into a state from the Middle Kingdom only came to be when the old Shu-Han decisively defeated and captured the barbarian king Meng Huo not once, not twice, but seven times."
 shu_sichuan_valley: "Sichuan Valley"
 shu_sichuan_valley_desc: "The valley that Chengdu is in is a blessed one. It's very easily defendable, with small passages serving as chokepoints, barring foreigners. But inside is a fertile and prosperous valley. We will defend those passages to the last man."
 shu_sino_christians: "Sino-Christians"
 shu_sino_christians_desc: "We have been blessed by the Virgin Mary herself, and now, we are Christians. Sadly, many of other men from the Middle Kingdom still have not converted. We are to give them a hand and enlighten them in the one true path."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "The rulers of Shu descend from the Han dynasty, the first one to unify the sinosphere completely and apply pressure on foreigners. We must honor our ancestry and build an empire even greater."
 shu_sleeping_dragons: "Sleeping Dragons"
 shu_sleeping_dragons_desc: "If we are to extend our dominion, we will need strategists. Gifted scholars of the art of war might just become the sleeping dragons of our time."
 shu_direct_draft: "Direct Drafting"
 shu_direct_draft_desc: "By not delegating the duty of drafting to the local prefects, keeping it a part of the central state's authority, fake censuses will not be forged by potentially corrupt governors."
 
 WUU_ideas: "Wu Ideas"
 WUU_ideas_start: "Wu Traditions"
 WUU_ideas_bonus: "Wu Ambition"
 
 wu_idea_1: "Huangpu Estuary"
 wu_idea_1_desc: "The Huangpu is a man-made river that flows through our region, and a major tributary of the Yangtze river. In its shores, more souls thrive than in most other dense regions of the world."
 wu_idea_2: "The Art of War"
 wu_idea_2_desc: "Sun Tzu, the writer behind The Art of War, is said to have been born in Jiangdong - Wu home territory. We will uphold his principles and ideas to the end of the days."
 wu_idea_3: "Legacy of Wu"
 wu_idea_3_desc: "Wu at this point refers more to a region than a dynasty, as in the past, multiple states in the region claimed the name for their newfound state. The one thing them all had in common was a legacy of fierce warrior rulers."
 wu_idea_4: "Hearts of Fire"
 wu_idea_4_desc: "Many say the soldiers of Wu are known for having a fire in their eyes that never extinguishes regardless of the odds. While they see the fire in their eyes, we'll see the white in theirs as our men tear them apart."
 wu_idea_5: "Naval Expansionism"
 wu_idea_5_desc: "It is imperative that, as a state based on the mouth of a large river and on the edge of a continent, we maintain a large fleet, be it for the sake of trading or for military purposes. We might not have a thalassocratic past, but that musn't stop us."
 wu_idea_6: "Enlisting Pirates"
 wu_idea_6_desc: "It has been a tradition to recruit willing pirates to the ranks of the Wu army and navy. They may be loud and uneducated, but they are experienced soldiers and sailors, and the prospect of a future within the army, perhaps even as officers, is largely attractive. That will help in the times of instability thought the Middle Kingdom."
 wu_idea_7: "Repel the Northerners"
 wu_idea_7_desc: "Wu has driven away all sorts of invaders from the North multiple times. We will not let the Yuan, Ming or any other petty warlord to subjugate us."
 
 min_ideas: "Min Ideas"
 min_ideas_start: "Min Traditions"
 min_ideas_bonus: "Min Ambition"
 min_1: "Expand the Trade Network"
 min_1_desc: "We've a fine network already estabilished through which trade flows in the coasts of the China sea. Yet it is imperative that this network is under permanent growth if we desire to also see economic growth."
 min_2: "Center of the Ideas Trade"
 min_2_desc: "Whether it is from the Central Plains up North or foreigners from the South, we stand at the crossroads of the innovations. The ideas trade passes us and leaves a legacy that we won't forget."
 min_3: "Foreign Embassies"
 min_3_desc: "Most rulers of Middle Kingdom have seen themselves as invencible and never thought foreigners had anything of value. If this were true, for one, the Mongols would not have successfully conquered all of us in the first place. There is always something to learn from others, and we must permit the structure of diplomacy so that we will always have someone to learn from."
 min_4: "Junker Expeditions"
 min_4_desc: "Not often do the people of the Middle Kingdom leave their homelands to explore the unknown, perhaps because it is a rich place without equal, but we are willing to go the distance if it means it'll make us more powerful."
 min_5: "Marine Warfare"
 min_5_desc: "Marines and amphibious landings have been the Min's preferred form of combat. Covering our soldiers from the boats as well as maintaining our supplies up is paramount for success, and thus far, it's been working."
 min_6: "Sino-colonialism"
 min_6_desc: "While not practiced in an overseas situation, the many dynasties that ruled our land have many times engaged on resettlement and colonialism. We're merely adding a new form of it to the list."
 min_7: "Mingle with Natives"
 min_7_desc: "The issue of overseas colonies is that they are often in a much higher risk situation due to the lack of an easy reinforcement route for our soldiers. We've got to be prepared to placate the locals somewhat so reinforcements are less needed."
 
 qin_ideas: "Qin Ideas"
 qin_ideas_start: "Qin Traditions"
 qin_ideas_bonus: "Qin Ambition"
 qin_1: "The Northern Silk Road"
 qin_1_desc: "A lot of wealth is poured worldwide from the Silk Road's many routes, and the Hexi corridor, the one point in which all routes connect in the North, is under our control."
 qin_2: "Power Checks"
 qin_2_desc: "One of the reasons the Yuan is having trouble controlling their court and their provinces alike is a lack of commitment to adding checks to every power that isn't the central one. We can't just watch that happen and then do the exact same thing."
 qin_3: "Unprecedented Religious Conflicts"
 qin_3_desc: "As religions poured in from the Silk Road, our old traditions were displaced or altered beyond belief. We felt the shock moreso than anyone else, for being at the doorstep of the road. Whether we'll ever come across a similar situation again is unknown, but we'll be sure it won't be as harmful."
 qin_4: "Xibei Infrastructure"
 qin_4_desc: "Xibei province is sorely lacking in proper infrastructure, even though the terrain is prime for a large, singular road connecting it all."
 qin_5: "Liang Province Horsemen"
 qin_5_desc: "Liang province, where we lay, is known for having some of the best horses in the Middle Kingdom. Coincidentally, it's also known for having the best horsemen."
 qin_6: "Origins of the Empires"
 qin_6_desc: "In our homelands, the original Dynasties that controlled all of the Middle Kingdom were born - the Qin and the Han. We're going to be the next ones in this list!"
 qin_7: "King of Hanzhong"
 qin_7_desc: "Hanzhong has served as the original capital of the first truly glorious Dynasty, the Han. The city has decayed in economic importance, but the buildings remain, and so does the attached prestige."
 
 jin_ideas: "Jin Ideas"
 jin_ideas_start: "Jin Traditions"
 jin_ideas_bonus: "Jin Ambition"
 jin_1: "Ming Antagonism"
 jin_1_desc: "We're constantly antagonized by the Ming for siding against them. Well, let them know it's mutual, and that our men get hyped at the mention that they'll be shooting Red Turbans."
 jin_2: "Loyalty above all"
 jin_2_desc: "The key word behind the fall of Empires is a lack of loyalty. If you can't trust someone, you shouldn't let them grow in power. This is basic, but many don't seem to catch on. The Yuan sure didn't."
 jin_3: "Open up a Bureau of Barbarians"
 jin_3_desc: "Being on the dangerous Northern frontier of the Middle Kingdom has the amazing 'benefit' of getting raided all of the time by all of the tribal peoples up North. They calmed down during Mongol rule (since they were part of the same state), but if the Mongols lose their way, it's best to make sure we know how to handle their politics for our interest."
 jin_4: "Intellectuals at Court"
 jin_4_desc: "It's important for the continued function of the state that it is manned by a capable bureaucracy of the greatest minds of the age."
 jin_5: "Eight Gates Formation"
 jin_5_desc: "A defensive attack formation devised in a previous warlord age, it focuses on slow yet well-planned movement that ensures our men are taking the least amount of damage possible, is solid enough to protect the flanks, and has no obvious weaknesses."
 jin_6: "Tuntian System"
 jin_6_desc: "This system, devised by distant ancestors of our Dynasty, was created to fill in an army quickly and supply it efficiently, by assuring every able-bodied man in an assigned area is either farming or serving. It's strict, so it must be kept for periods of prolonged war. But it's efficient."
 jin_7: "The Great Wall"
 jin_7_desc: "Perhaps one of the greatest legacies that the Middle Kingdom has left for us - and we will leave for whoever succeeds us - is the Great Wall. It protects our lands from direct attacks from barbarians of all kinds, as a massive deterrent first, and a gigantic obstacle second. This marvel of engineering shall not disappoint us."

 chagatayid_ideas_bonus: "Chagatai Khaganate Ambition"
 
 chagatayid_1: "Advanced Logistics"
 chagatayid_1_desc: "When the Mongol Empire was first split, the Chagatai Khaganate was left with the landlocked regions of Central Asia, a large part of which is dry or outright arid. War logistics in the region are more complex, and, thus, we've slowly learned to handle it."
 chagatayid_2: "The Mongol Ways"
 chagatayid_2_desc: "The Mongols did not fall because they fell obsolete at the art of war, but for administrative and diplomatic issues. Their ways are still a strong method of achieving great victories."
 chagatayid_3: "Glory of the Bloodline"
 chagatayid_3_desc: "The Chagatayids descend from Chagatai Khan, a son of Genghis, which, by extension, makes the Chagatai Khagans direct heirs to Genghis and his legacy."
 chagatayid_4: "Control of the Silk Road"
 chagatayid_4_desc: "The land route of the Silk Road passes straight through Chagatai territory, and alternative land routes are simply not viable. This can be used for our economic advantage."
 chagatayid_5: "Central Asian Divergences"
 chagatayid_5_desc: "Central Asia is home to many different faiths, such as Nestorianism, Buddhism, Tengriism and Manichaeism. A ruler unwilling to compromise in such a location is ill-prepared to lead these peoples."
 chagatayid_6: "Destiny of the Bloodline"
 chagatayid_6_desc: "It's in our destiny to reclaim glory that can compete with that of our predecessors of Temujin, Chagatai and Esen Buqa Khans. Let's walk into the future with the goal of honoring those who brought us here by outdoing them."
 chagatayid_7: "Ressuscitate Mongol Influence"
 chagatayid_7_desc: "Our rebirth as the major power of Central Asia is merely a step towards the reunification of the Great Mongol Empire. All of it is bound to return to our hands at some point."
