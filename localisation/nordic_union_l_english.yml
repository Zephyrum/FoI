While relations were always cordial, the countries never were formally united into a personal union. But this is now to change. Since Kristina I of Norway married her third cousin Karl VIII of Sweden, they were co-rulers of each others domain, and now their son Erik the Lucky will succeed his parents onto the thrones of both nations, as Erik XV of Sweden, III of Norway."

While relations were always cordial, the countries never were formally united into a personal union. This is not likely to change soon. Since Kristina I of Norway married her third cousin Karl VIII of Sweden, they were co-rulers of each others domain, but with the severe illness and soon certainly the death of their son Erik, the future of both nations seemed uncertain. Luckily, Kristina got with child again, and to everyone's surprise, twins - a boy and a girl - were born. Many see that as a sign, that the nations shall not yet be united. The boy, Frej, shall inherit Sweden, his fathers domain, while his sister Froya will succeed her mother on the throne of Norway.\n\n§GNOTE FROM DEVELOPERS§!: This is a multiplayer-only option, to prevent hugboxes."
