 cathar_religion_desc:0 "The Cathar, or Albigensian, heresy rejects confession and the holiness of the clergy and of the Pope. They only have a single sacrament - the Consolamentum - to remove sin and turn the believer into a Cathar 'Perfecti'.\nThe Cathars power's was broken in Southern France during the early 13th century, when the North African Crusaders, on their way to the Occitan port cities, persecuted any communities and individuals accused of Cathatism. Sensing an opportunity to crack down on the rampant feudalism in their land, the king in Toulouse somewhat successfully channelled most of these energies against unruly and powerful vassals of his. Leaving some scorched trail of murder and castle-storming behind them but leaving most of the region intact after some costly damage control from their suzerain who promptly and sometimes roughly send them on their way as soon as possible afterwards. This bloody affair would be the first step on their road to doom, for the infamous 'Crusade of Discord' of 1226.\nWith their power base and protectors broken, the begrudging tolerance accorded to the Cathars quickly dwindled as more and more repressive and harsh measure aimed to eradicate the survivors were enforced by their Catholic lords, and the short lived Occitan Inquisition of the late 13th century. Nonetheless they still exist in small minorities all around the kingdom of Toulouse, mainly in the Pyrenees Mountains."

For nearly a year they held out, and only the ever growing numbers of the besiegers, and hunger forced them to surrender. Even though, some of them were granted a royal pardon, all defenders were burnt at the stake, which soured the kings relations with the Occitan Inquisition, and led to their dissolution shortly after.

Stating that the Caliph wasn't worthy anymore after negotiating with a rebel group. Their immediate repression by Marwan II pushed them to retaliate by assassinating him and adopting more intransigent and unorthodox stances. Mostly by rejecting the infallibility of the Caliph and thus that any Caliph should be elected between the most pious Muslims, even if he wasn't Arab. A Schism, however, divided them between Kharijite and Munharafis and by 1444, the majority of the Kharijite are holding in the Nadj desert."
