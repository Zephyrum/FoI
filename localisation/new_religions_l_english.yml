 #Tadmunism
 tadmunism: "Tadmunite"
 tadmunism_religion_desc: "Founded by the Prophet Aksil Tadmund in the 10th century and inspired by many other Christian movements such as Donatism and Arianism as well as Judaism and pre-Abrahamic Berber religion, Tadmunism rejects all kinds of patriarchal authority and was the main faith of all Berbers from Mauretania to Fezzan under the Imwehheden Empire. The religion was integral in the final revolt against the Greeks that pushed the Byzantines out of North Africa, but by 1444, the Catholic Crusades have all but eradicated the faith, pushing its followers into the deserts and mountains."
 HOLY_SITE_346_DESC:0 "Once the capital of the mighty Imwehheden Empire, the city of Tafilalt was the site of the only Tadmunite Council ever held. It is also home to the Cathedral of the Prophet Aksil, constructed during the zenith of Imwehheden rule."
 HOLY_SITE_2469_DESC:0 "Dukkala houses the tomb of the Prophet Aksil, and one's pilgrimage to this tomb is considered the most holy and important pilgrimage in the Tadmunite faith."
 HOLY_SITE_2454_DESC:0 "The Battle of Sufetula is regarded as the turning point in the spread of the teachings of Aksil Tadmund, when His warriors, through divine intervention, beat back the Byzantine menace and secured North Africa for the native peoples. The battleground of Sufetula is now a holy site dedicated to those who fought in this battle."
 HOLY_SITE_1132_DESC:0 "The First and Second Crusades were characterized by their brutality, as the invaders forced the native populations to flee North Africa. Many made their way across the desert to Timbuktu, and the Tadmunite presence here served as an important relay point for missionaries making their way from the north during the time of the Imwehheden Empire. Since the fall of the Imwehhedens, the city has served as a major intellectual and theological center for the faith."
 HOLY_SITE_2457_DESC:0 "Deep in the desert, the most prestigious mausoleum of the Imwehheden rulers can be found. The reasoning behind the decision to bury the Imwehheden Emperors here is unclear, but nevertheless the bodies of the last Imwehheden rulers lie here."

Ignited in the lands of old Parthia, this temple's fire is one of the flames that are said to have been ignited by Zoroaster himself. The temple has been desecrated by many barbarian hordes multiple times in the past."
 HOLY_SITE_409_DESC:0 "When old Babylon was conquered by the Persians, serving as a testament to Persian might that sent ripples across the world, the faith of Zoroaster spread to the region and multiple temples were created. The city has served as capital to many Iranian dynasties and was one important center of arts, learning and faith."
 HOLY_SITE_2362_DESC:0 "The verdant valley of Khwarezmia is the location where scholars estimate that Zoroaster himself was born. While the location isn't quite as lush as tales told - time wasn't very kind to this region - these long plains gave birth to our prophet, and are of tremendous significance."
