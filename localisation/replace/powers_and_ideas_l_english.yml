 the_ghulams:0 "Abolish State Banditry"
 the_ghulams_desc:0 "Many wish to forget that the first Afsharid to rule all of Persia, Narsieh I, was nothing more than the chief of a group of bandits; bandits who were still more like bandits than soldiers when Narsieh established the Afsharid dynasty from the ashes of the Ilkhanate. Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."
