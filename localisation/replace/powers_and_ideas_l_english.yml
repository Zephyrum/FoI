For centuries the Albanian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came.

We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. Unfriendly armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs."

Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tabarestani coast there’s everything from Manicheans and Zoroastrians to Christian Nestorians, Myaphisites and Orthodoxes. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war.

Able administrators must rise to high positions regardless of which family they come from."
