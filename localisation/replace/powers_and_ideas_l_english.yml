To secure our position, a military expedition was decided against the independant duchy of Catalonia, the region was quickly subdued and integrated. But soon came an unsuspected surprise: a popular local written work, made by the catalonian people, named "The Consulate of the Sea" was discovered.

Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."
 
 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc:1 "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized extremist sects that many of the Turkoman warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of both the tribes and the extremist clergymen without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."
 akk_expansive_diplomacy_desc:1 "Our realm lies at a crossroad between the empires of the Mediterranean and those of Greater Iran. In many ways this region is one of few friends and many enemies.

 sis_chronicles_of_sistan_desc:1 "Through the centuries the dynasties of Sakastan have often found it wise to chronicle their own history as rulers of the province.

But this must change; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. Unfriendly armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs."

We have centuries of experience fighting off invaders and a fantastic understanding of how to best use our lands terrain to our advantage when fighting off these invaders. We don't follow traditional military tactics and march our men into valleys to have them face the enemy head-on we take to the hills, confuse the enemy, use our infantry to lure them, while our hidden cavalry flanks their exposed rear.

Not only does it have to remain competitive against numerous would-be conquerors, it has to retain its expertise in fighting in virtually every terrain type - from steppes, to plains and lowlands to forests, hills and mountains. Our ancestors never feared these challenges, they rose to face them with legendary success and grace, and so shall we once again."
 bul_idea_7:1 "Lessons from Rome"
 bul_idea_7_desc:1 "The golden age of Rome is over. Just as the once mighty empire has fallen, its Greek successors seem to move in the same direction. It is now up to Bulgaria to use our position in Europe at the heart of one of the continent's largest trade route intersections, as well as our royal ties to the Byzantine throne and claim the legacy of Rome.

Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tabarestani coast there’s everything from Manichaeans and Zoroastrians to Christian Nestorians, Myaphisites and Orthodoxes. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war. We must build strong fortresses to guard the passes that lead through the mountains that protect us, and keep strong garrisons at hand to protect the freedom we enjoy."

Through the centuries the Georgian church has served as an increasingly unifying force in all Georgian states up to the unification of the country under the Bagrationi dynasty. From then on the Church has served as a central element in Georgian culture, in the face of Byzantine as well as Mongol or Persian influence. With the splintered loyalties within Georgia today the Church still has an important role to play as a unifying force against outsiders."

From there their goods are sent south along the Shire and Zambezi river systems before they are taken over by the distribution system of the Kingozi trade states.

A major drought could render much of our kingdom useless desert, an addition to the Sahara where no one reigns but death. However, in good years, we might reclaim some of the marginal land from the Sahara and make it productive again."
 mandinka_warrior_spirit_desc:1 "Whether pagan or Muslim, Mandinka men have been the greatest fighters the Agisymba has ever seen. The courage of our troops is admirable, as is their pride. When the Mansa raises an army, not only is it the largest in all the Agisymba, its the best."

 dlh_afghan_nobility_desc:1 "Converts to the Manichaean faith the Pashtuns have been a crucial part of the Shahdom's nobility since its formation in the early 13th century. These nobles have contributed to the Shahdom's successful military campaigns against the Vagehla of Gujarat and Deva of Bengal. Yet they have also been a hindrance due to their aid of pretender shahs which have resulted in civil wars. Even though at times they have been a political hindrance, their martial skills are beyond question."
 dlh_suppress_rebellion:1 "Elevate the casteless"
 dlh_suppress_rebellion_desc:1 "The Prophet Gautama Buddha has condemned the caste system for which he considered as an unjust system. He pointed to the innate truth that there exists cruel and wicked people as well as kind and virtuous people in every caste. This innate truth can be seen as well in merit and skill. By elevating the castless based on merit and giving them a place in our kingdom we can gain their loyalty while further decreasing the power of the nobility."
 dlh_expansionism:1 "Yamagnatic Administration"
 dlh_expansionism_desc:1 "Residing in our Realm the Yamag has played a crucial role in the administration of the Shahdom. As the successor of the final Prophet Mani Hayya, the Yamag is the head of the Manichaean Church. At times this relationship between the Shah and the Yamag has been tense and has resulted in internal conflict. Even with these periods of internal conflict his importance can not be underestimated.

 dlh_reconquest:1 "Re-integrate Former Provinces"
 dlh_reconquest_desc:1 "When our ancestors first arrived in Doab the region was divided amongst various Rajputs. This division allowed the early Shahs of Delhi to unite the Indo-Gangetic plains. The following century would see the Shahdom reach its height uniting all of Northern India. However, this unity would not last as the following decades would see multiple civil wars, raids from Kartids and an invasion from the Tibetan Kingdom. The Manichaean realms are now divided and have become vulnerable from outside threats. Let us restore this past glory of the shah by bringing these territories back under the authority of Delhi."

 mys_reform_silk_industry:1 "Reform the Silk Industry"
 mys_reform_silk_industry_desc:1 "While the Mysorean economy is strong in many ways we envy the silk industries of Bengal and Gujarat. The best way to improve and support our domestic production might be to send forth agents to study how others have fared and then implement reforms to mimic these things in our own way. Together with the excellent craftsmanship of our own artisans this should allow our economy to flourish."

These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in faraway ports. We must not take these traders for granted, however. By establishing ports and villages that are free of taxes and tolls we may persuade domestic and foreign traders alike to keep their bases of operation in our lands rather than that of our neighbors.

Recent times have also seen increasing migration into our lands from the north, many of these new subjects tend to settle in the drier regions where they won't have to compete with existing settlements. In many cases, these regions might also be quite productive given that adequate investments into canals and water tanks could be made.

Apart from the indigenous Telugu, Kannada and Tamil groups Maratha horsemen, Persian or Turani Horsemen, Turkoman gunners, Mavales and Berads are all competing to serve in our armies. Among other things this competition means that hiring these groups is cheaper than it might otherwise have been."

While taking control over all these areas would be an arduous and lengthy process we might instead attempt to insert people loyal to us in the local hierarchies. With a royal mandate to create, improve and defend fortified settlements these new leaders would rely on authority bestowed on them by the state rather than ancient traditions.

Indeed in recent times, these temple complexes have been growing even more grand and monumental, with South Indian temple complexes in many ways dwarfing those that can be found in northern India.

We adopted this title to distance ourselves from the Bogomilist Kingdom of Bosnia, and to venerate the great Saint Sava who had been a unifying icon for many of the different peoples of the Balkans. Saint Sava was a count of Hum who abandoned his royal titles to become a monk on Mount Athos, which he would then transform into an important religious center for the Orthodox church with the establishment of the Monastary of Hilandar.

 balkan_hajduks:1 "Balkan Hajduks"
 balkan_hajduks_desc:1 "Unlike their northern counterparts in Bulgaria, Hajduks in Serbia and neighboring Balkan lands have earned a more infamous reputation. These men lived the hard life of brigands, always in danger, always on the move: preying on poorly defended roads, ambushing Turkish tax collectors and merchants.

 #Bosnian ideas

 empower_bosnian_nobility_desc:1 "History of medieval Bosnia has been one of everlasting balance between its rulers and their nobles. Pressured from the outside by both Rome and Bulgaria eager to conquer Bosnian lands, in the past rulers of Bosnia have had to proclaim themselves nominally both Catholic and Orthodox, in order to prevent crusades against their domains. But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church. This meant that ruling Bosnia was a perpetual game of balance, one that only masters of this game could play and live to tell. In this game of thrones, you either win or you die."
