 heirs_of_pasai:0 "Preservation of History"
 heirs_of_pasai_desc:0 "Though texts describing our culture's history are scarce, our history is still carried on through oral tradition. We must encourage the passing down of our history from generation to generation."

 ASU_ideas:1 "Asturian Ideas"
 ASU_ideas_start:1 "Asturian Traditions"
 ASU_ideas_bonus:1 "Asturian Ambition"
 asu_reconquista:1 "Quadruple Crown"
 asu_reconquista_desc:1 "The Asturian Kingdom is an amalgamation of four entities, each with different institutions, culture and languages, forming more a confederation of principalities rather than a single entity. While some foreigners appearently see us as a decadent byproduct of arbitrary divisions, it ultimately does well at keeping our subjects united."
 asu_camino_de_santiago:1 "Leonese School"
 asu_camino_de_santiago_desc:1 "The duchy of Leon, founded after the final disintegration of the Visigothic kingdom is mainly known for it's prestigious university. If we put all the students from the four realms on an equal footing, we can at least expect to create a new common generation of scholars who will greatly benefit our intellectual development."
 asu_aristocracy:1 "Vardulian Example"
 asu_aristocracy_desc:1 "The duchy of Vardulias, also founded after the ultimate demise of Visigothic kingdom, was placed in a crossroads position, leaving it vulnerable from all sides. It didn't take long to see a vigorous martial culture emerging; they were soon well known for their bravery on the battlefield."
 asu_colonialism:1 "Aragonese Administration"
 asu_colonialism_desc:1 "All of our lands, it seems, are more or less plagued by a lack of centralization; however the county of Aragon has established a well balanced administration. If we align our 3 other administrations to that model, we can expect great result in the long term."
 asu_millenarian_revival:1 "Iberian Singularism"
 asu_millenarian_revival_desc:1 "Our country is made of many different peoples, all with different tongues and customs. We've shown the world our capacity to treat our subjects well, it's time we continue to integrate any other peoples we might come to rule."
 asu_unify_the_provinces:1 "Catalonian Gift"
 asu_unify_the_provinces_desc:1 "The last integration in the realm was not made by succesion games, but by steel and pain. To secure our position, a military expedition was decided against the independant duchy of Catalonia, the region was quickly subdued and integrated. But soon came an unsuspected surprise: a popular local written work, made by the catalonian people, named "The Consulate of the Sea" was discovered. Our nation has alway lacked the experience of a strong naval force, but know we can hope to catch up in this domain."
 asu_early_industrialism:1 "Open up the Bureau of Diplomacy"
 asu_early_industrialism_desc:1 "The lack of appropriate measures of foreign policy has alienated our position in Iberia over time, due to a mix of arrogance and just flat-out incompetence. We must ensure this never happens again."

 the_ghulams:0 "Abolish State Banditry"
 the_ghulams_desc:0 "Many wish to forget that the first Afsharid to rule all of Persia, Narsieh I, was nothing more than the chief of a group of bandits; bandits who were still more like bandits than soldiers when Narsieh established the Afsharid dynasty from the ashes of the Ilkhanate. Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."
 
 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc:0 "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized extremist sects that many of the Turkoman warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of both the tribes and the extremist clergymen without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."
 akk_expansive_diplomacy_desc:0 "Our realm lies at a crossroad between the empires of the Mediterranean and those of Greater Iran. In many ways this region is one of few friends and many enemies. If we are to find allies we will have to look far abroad, perhaps even among the realms of the far west."
 
 the_qizilbash_desc:1 "The Qizilbash, or Red Heads, are a Zoroastrian military movement ready to fight and die for their religious convictions. They are ready to support our state and could form the nucleolus of our army."
 improved_silk_road_desc:0 "A system of upgrades to roads and bridges, a system of guards to protect the roads (for a small tax) and a chain of Caravanserai to provide rest stops; all help the merchants as they traverse the Silk Road and also provide increased revenue for the state."
 
 sis_loyal_service_desc:0 "Sistan’s time as a great empire may have been short but for centuries we have provided armies and leaders for the wars of Ilkhans, Karts, and even Timur. We should proudly preserve this tradition of service in our ranks as we make good use of the experience earned in the war of foreign powers."


 greek_klephtic_irregulars:0 "Klephtic Recruitment"
 greek_klephtic_irregulars_desc:0 "Hellenic people have for centuries been the inventors of new military tactics and strategies. The phalanx, the chariot, cataphracts; all were Greek inventions. It is important to not forget the military prowess implied in Greek warfare."
 greek_phanariotes:0 "Greek Diaspora"
 greek_phanariotes_desc:0 "Educated and resourceful men are always in demand and as a result many of our countrymen have during the centuries moved abroad to take service in the courts of countries all over Europe.

 king_of_jerusalem:0 "Greek Heritage"
 king_of_jerusalem_desc:0 "Our people share a great deal of history with our mainland brethren. Though the sea separates us, we are still descended from the same Hellenic people as the Byzantines. Let us not forget; the legacy of ancient Greece, with all its philosophy and history, lives on in us."
 frankish_crusaders:0 "Innovative Military"
 frankish_crusaders_desc:0 "It's not a coincidence that the Saracens collectively refer to the people of Christendom as Franks: French presence in the Crusades has been critical ever since the earliest days. The spirit of the crusader kings like Philippe II Auguste and St. Louis IX isn't absent in Cyprus: our own King Peter once heroically seized a bit of the Anatolian coastline. Let's prove we still have that fire in us."
 commandaria_wine:0 "Commandaria Wine"
 commandaria_wine_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Third Crusade, Philippe II Auguste of France held a contest to determine the greatest wine in the world. Does it shock anyone that our Commandaria proved the Apostle of Wines in this greatest of competitions? Commandaria is ancient and just as tasty as it was hundreds of years ago. Even the Turks have developed a taste for it, despite supposedly refraining from alcohol."
 lusignan_diplomacy:0 "Lusignan Diplomacy"
 lusignan_diplomacy_desc:0 "What king of Christendom doesn't covet the title King of Jerusalem? Sadly, many have claimed it despite our continued hold on the title, but others respect us enough to wish to infuse their own dynasties with Lusignan blood to bring themselves closer to the Holy Land in name and spirit. This last redoubt of Christendom in the East cannot survive without Western help, so we must take advantage of this."
 cypriot_fortifications:0 "Cypriot Fortifications"
 cypriot_fortifications_desc:0 "Many, many powers have swept through Cyprus over the centuries, and the Crusaders have no desire to be just one in a succession of owners. Everywhere you look, this island is fortified with the finest examples of Medieval castles and fortifications, proof that we are here to stay, to the dismay of both the Turks and the Greek locals."
 repel_the_corsairs:0 "Repel the Corsairs"
 repel_the_corsairs_desc:0 "The memories of the legendary Barbarossa brothers who bedeviled the Eastern Mediterranean in the late 15th and early 16th centuries is vivid, but they were only the most famous of the many corsairs that are the bane of Mediterranean sea travel. Our navy needs to gain the strength to match these freebooters on their own terms."
 raid_turkish_commerce:0 "Raid Turkish Commerce"
 raid_turkish_commerce_desc:0 "Perhaps the brothers Barbarossa, brutes that they were, hit on a valuable strategy. We can utilize our critical position in the Eastern Mediterranean to launch unrestricted raiding on Turkish vessels and reap the economic rewards of their wealth. Pirates may be the enemies of all nations, but privateers are merely contracted businessmen, right?"
