 caspian_safe_haven_desc:1 "This region has often been a safe haven for people of different cultures and religions. Priests, warlords or merchants can all find a place here. Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tabarestani coast there’s everything from Manicheans and Zoroastrians to Christian Nestorians, Myaphisites and Orthodoxes. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war. We must build strong fortresses to guard the passes that lead through the mountains that protect us, and keep strong garrisons at hand to protect the freedom we enjoy."
