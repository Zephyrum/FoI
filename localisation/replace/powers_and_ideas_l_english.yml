 aju_maritime_enterprise:1 "Maritime Enterprise"
 aju_maritime_enterprise_desc:1 "Since ancient times our ancestors were an important link in the Horn of Africa connecting the commerce of the region with the rest of the world. Our sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of spices and various luxury goods. We should keep supporting this profitable trade network and maintain maritime contacts with Arabia, Egypt, Persia, Tamilakam, and as far away as China."
 istunka_tournament:1 "Istunka Tournament"
 istunka_tournament_desc:1 "Historically the Istunka was an annually held tournament developed in the Ajuuraan State, and was centralized in the 19th century under the Kingdom of Geledi. The event consists of several teams engaging each other in mock combat."

 aju_muslim_migrations_desc:1 "Christians from Arabia, Egypt, Persia and Tamilakam come and settle in our coastal cities.

Due to their strong tradition in learning, they will enrich our lands and we will employ them as advisers and commanders."
 aju_expelling_the_infidel:1 "Expelling the Heretics"
 aju_expelling_the_infidel_desc:1 "We have received news that the cities of our Kingozi brethren to the South were sacked and plundered by the Lusitanians heretics. These pesky westerners won't stop until they subjugate the rest of East Africa. We should prepare ourselves and show fierce resistance!"
 aju_received_assistance:1 "Egyptian Assistance"
 aju_received_assistance_desc:1 "Our traditional weapons such as the sword, spear, and bow are not sufficient any more in our struggle against the Lusitanians. By keeping good relations with our Egyptian brethren we could receive assistance in the form of firearms and cannons which will be much more effective in dealing with these heretics."

 #Ethiopia Ideas

 #Nubian Ideas

From the Romans of ancient times to the Italians, Arabs and Egyptians of today, for centuries foreign traders have come to Nubian marketplaces to trade in our goods. Let us encourage long-distance trade in all directions."
 nubian_religious_struggles_desc:1 "Though the Miaphysites are the clear majority, Nubia has always been home to many religions, from Orthodox Christians to Animists and even other traditional religions. Unlike in some parts of the world, these faiths have gotten along well. Nubia prides itself on religious tolerance, and in Nubian cities and towns, one may find people of many faiths. We must embrace this fact if we are to rise to greatness."

 #Somali Ideas
 somali_offensive_warfare_desc:1 "Somali warriors, though few and far between, have been sought after by many nations, near and far, to serve as mercenaries in their armies. By enacting laws that forbid serving in foreign militaries, we can ensure that our own armies, and not those of other nations or our enemies, reflect the fighting spirit of the Somali people."

 great_mosque_of_kilwa_desc:1 "The Kingozi culture is a mélange of Arab, Persian, Christian, and Bantu traditions.

 indian_ocean_melting_pot_desc:1 "Kingozi city states are always exciting affairs. You never know if you'll find an Omani seaman, a Gujarati captain, a Malay spice trader, or even a brave merchant from the mysterious Island of the Moon, Madagascar.

 recruit_the_unbelievers_desc:1 "Sadly, the people of the interior have not yet heard the word of God, but even unbelievers have faith in the power of the gold coin. The riches of our land may attract them to serve under our banner... perhaps someday it will even inspire them to live righteously."

 akk_turko_iranian_bureaucracy_desc:1 "For us, it is easy to conquer and keep conquered peoples under control. However, if we are to extract any form of revenue from our new subjects we will need to rely not only on our military elites. There is no reason that the old administrative families of our newly-conquered lands should not continue to carry out their work, as long as they are aware who is really in control."
 akk_expansive_diplomacy:1 "Expansive Diplomacy"
 akk_expansive_diplomacy_desc:1 "Our realm lies at a crossroad between the empires of the Mediterranean and those of Greater Iran. In many ways this region is one of few friends and many enemies.

 akk_religious_pragmatism:1 "Religious Pragmatism"
 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc:1 "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized extremist sects that many of the Turkomen warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of both the tribes and the extremist clergymen without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."

 #Mali Ideas
 reclamation_of_land_desc:1 "The Tinariwin doesn't stay in one place...it can wax and wane depending on rainfall, and the habitable belt known as the Agisymba we reside in can grow or shrink accordingly. A major drought could render much of our kingdom useless desert, an addition to the Tinariwin where no one reigns but death. However, in good years, we might reclaim some of the marginal land from the Tinariwin and make it productive again."
 mandinka_warrior_spirit_desc:1 "Whether pagan or Muslim, Mandinka men have been the greatest fighters the Agisymba has ever seen. The courage of our troops is admirable, as is their pride. When the Mansa raises an army, not only is it the largest in all the Agisymba, its the best."

Let us support this group over all others by baring Kingozi traders as well as European fortune seekers from trading within our borders."
 #Malagasy Ideas
 malagasy_fortify_coastline_desc:1 "Kingozi and Arab traders are eager to sell us gold and to trade for cloth, slaves and cattle but not everyone that seek our harbors have good intentions. We must always keep the fortifications of our port cities up to date so that they are able to withstand oversea raids as well as invasions from the center of the island."
 #Maravi Ideas
 mra_ivory_trade_desc:1 "Traditionally all traders of ivory converge at the southern end of Lake Malawi. From there their goods are sent south along the Shire and Zambezi river systems before they are taken over by the distribution system of the Kingozi trade states. We have an excellent position to control this trade and develop the Lake Malawi trade region."

 tbk_welcome_the_swahili_merchants_desc:1 "A growing number of Kingozi Merchants have begun to settle in our lands as a result of the growing overland trade between our lands and the coastal cities. The Kingozi have much longer experience of being part of the Indian Ocean Trade network and we could well stand to benefit from their experience. We should both allow and encourage this trend as a way to develop our trade network, regardless of any ill will from our own merchant community."

 legacy_seljuqs_empire_desc:1 "From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuq Turks advanced in the tenth century first into Khwarasan and then into mainland Persia before eventually conquering Anatolia. They established an empire later called the Great Seljuk Khanate and had profound effects on the Near East.

 komnenoi_in_exile_desc:1 "As the 'War of the Three Eagles' ravaged both Greece and Micrasia, the Pontic provinces, afraid of the violence spilling over, and tired of fighting the wars of Constantinople, seceded under Theodosios Komnenos, an imperial prince, sympathetic to our cause. Should the Byzantine Civil War take an unexpected turn, it could soon be that only Pontus will be controlled by the great line of Komnenoi Byzantine emperors that saved Rome for the great Seljuk invasion."
 pontic_mountains:1 "Pontic Mountains"
 pontic_mountains_desc:1 "Much as the Alps separate the French and Italians, the Pontic Mountains separate the Greek coast from the Turks who have seized the inner parts of Estern Anatolia. Pontus has always been more Greek than rest of Eastern Anatolia...perhaps the legacy of the great Mithridates of old will inspire our warriors and strike as much fear into the Turks as he did the Romans?"
 legacy_of_the_alexiad:1 "Persian Refugees"
 legacy_of_the_alexiad_desc:1 "As the persecution of Persian Christians intensified under the Afsharids, many of their foremost scholars have fled their home and settled all over Anatolia. Especially the Pontic coast has proven a safe harbor for them, and the Persian quarter in Trebizond has developed into one of the most prosperous parts of the city. We should involve them more in our government, so the whole nation can benefit form their knowledge."
 komnenoi_princesses:1 "Komnenoi Princesses"
 komnenoi_princesses_desc:1 "The Komnenoi women have always been exceptionally talented. Rulers across Europe want the legitimacy of Komnenoi bloodline in their own families and our princesses have become one of our top exports.

 the_lessons_of_the_fourth_crusade_desc:1 "The Komnenoi, the Angeloi and the Palaiologoi have fought over the throne in Constantinople for centuries, a fight that crippled the nation for a long time, and reached it's peak in the 'War of the Three Eagles'. Our great founder Theodosios Komnenos fled this madness, determined to found a new and better Greek nation on the Pontic shores. We will never again bow to a nation led by self-serving idiots."

 terminus_of_the_silk_road_desc:1 "Even when this city was called Trapezus in the mists of Antiquity the ancient Greeks could see how useful a location it was, the point where the land route across Asia encounters the sea route that leads to the Mediterranean. In the days of the Khans, we grew famous as the terminal point for the great Silk Road, as the wealth of China and India passed through Trebizond on its way to Europe. There's no reason not to try to keep some of the wealth passing through."
 greek_scholars_abroad:1 "Greek Scholars Abroad"
 greek_scholars_abroad_desc:1 "In the ancient world, every educated man worthy of respect was educated by a Greek tutor, and this is still true today.

 #Rum Ideas
 rum_abul_fath:1 "Warriors of the Cross"
 rum_abul_fath_desc:1 "We have enemies in all directions, making a strong army a necessity for a state such as ours. Fortunately, we are not a weak people. From the irregular conscripts and the Akinci raiders to the Sipahis of the Turkish Beyliks, the world has come to know the military might of the Turkish people. Let us build an army for an Empire, taking inspiration from wherever military competence can be found while also drawing from the strengths and experiences of those that came before us."

 rum_king_of_the_east_and_west_desc:1 "Since the fall of Rûm the Turkish people have been divided, serving minor Beys from the Bosphorus to the mountains of Kurdistan. It was our duty to restore the legacy of the Seljuk Khans of Rûm and unite the Anatolian Turks. Our ambition however must be much higher than that. The Seljuk Turks once ruled one of the greatest empires known to man, it is evident to anyone who sees our empire that the restoration of this state is now our destiny, as is the reclamation of the Roman lands that were once ruled from what is now our heartland."
 rum_shahanshah:1 "Shahanshah"
 rum_shahanshah_desc:1 "The Empire of Rûm was not only an Anatolian state but also one that strongly honored the Persian traditions of kingship. Especially as the lands of Persia itself fell to the hands of Mongol conquerors. Under the Padishahs before us, Persianate culture blossomed, and Persian poets and scholars found patronage. Men such as Khurshid Ardehi, Qanaya Tahmasp, Ammanuel Vardanid, and Rumi himself made their homes under Rûm’s protection and the Padishahs themselves were versed in Persian literature and poetry.\nWe must cherish our Persian legacy as well as our Turkish and aspire to make our homeland a paragon of Persianate culture, the foremost of Christian nations."
 rum_sultan_of_rum:1 "Padishah of Rûm"
 rum_sultan_of_rum_desc:1 "The Padishahs of Rûm have ruled over the diverse populations of Anatolia, which includes both Nestorian and Heretical sects of Christianity. It was during their reign that Nestorianism would become the dominant faith of the Anatolian Turks, but their policies accepted all forms of Christianity. Often inviting even Heretics from the nearby lands to seek out the domain of Rûm. We would do well to learn from their example."
 rum_sulan_al_bahrayn:1 "Akdeniz'in Imparatoru" 
 rum_sulan_al_bahrayn_desc:1 "Unlike the Padishahs of the past we must establish a strong and durable navy that can withstand both pirates and the fleets of other Christians.

 rum_sultan_al_muazzam_desc:1 "The greatest of the Padishahs requires grand monuments and buildings.

 alh_desert_warfare_desc:1 "Our people came from the desert, fleeing from the murderous heathens of the early Caliphates. We took refuge at the shores of the sea, built a new home in the lands around the Catara peninsula, and tried to compete with the muslim traders of Hormuz and Oman. Even with the Caliphate long gone, the Muslim desert tribes, such as the Tamimids and Dawasir, now desire what is ours. While it is important that we embrace the maritime nature of our state we must never forget our Bedouin past, or other desert tribes could displace us from our refuge."

 alh_lord_of_the_eastern_bedouin_desc:1 "We have come a long way since we took control of Catara, Al-Haasa and Hofuf. We must however never forget that we would have lost our home to the muslims long ago, if it weren't for the powers that protected us. The great Horselords of the East, the Seljuk Khans came to our aide, in our darkest hour, drove back the Muslim forces, and ensured, that Al-Haasa would become the bastion of Nestorian Christendom that it is today."
 alh_fortify_the_coastline:1 "Fortify the coastline"
 alh_fortify_the_coastline_desc:1 "The trade cities of Eastern Arabia are where we earn our livelihood. The cities themselves however are vulnerable. Foreign ships might easily descend on the coastline and hold our traders hostage. This is how the Hormuzi constantly threaten us, and this is how the emerging trade powers of the West will likely do so in the future.\nWe would do well to build strong stone fortifications in our principal ports, so that we can protect the wealth of our merchants."
 alh_a_modern_navy:1 "A Modern Navy"
 alh_a_modern_navy_desc:1 "An increasing number of Western ships have been seen in the Persian gulf lately, and though they are fellow Christians, we can not be sure of their intentions. Should they turn out to be hostile to us, in order to battle this new enemy however we will need to build a new and modern navy. Let us hire seasoned shipbuilders from our Nestorian brothers in South of India, and also invite sailors from to settle in our country, that have already encountered the modern western vassals."

 alh_legacy_of_rahmah_ibn_jabir_desc:1 "Once the Seljuks saved us from loosing our independence, and forced conversion. For that we swore our unending loyalty to them, a promise that was made official in the Catara treaty. This treaty should have also been the first step on reuniting Arabia in the Name of Christ, but then the Seljuks were betrayed, and their empire fell. We still desire to reclaim Arabia and free it from the Muslim plight, even if we have to do it alone."

 #Mahra Ideas
 mhr_book_of_navigation_desc:1 "The skill and experience of our navigators is known from Menuthias to Timor, but we cannot risk trade secrets dying with a single man. We should have our best navigators compile a new handbook for navigation. Up to date and with no secrets kept, for the benefit of future generations of seamen."
 mhr_pilots_of_the_arabian_sea_desc:1 "We have sailed the waters of the Erythraean Sea for hundreds of years and few captains know the waters as well as we do. There are Mahri communities from the Kingozi cities of East Africa to the bustling suburbs of Cairo or Basra. Our maritime heritage has made our sailors highly sought after not only to man ships, but also as valuable pilots to guide ships of all nations through treacherous or unknown waters."

 melikdom_organization_desc:1 "As one of the few bastions of an independent Armenian state, Armenia was governed by feudal suzerains called tagavors, as the old nakharar system collapsed. The relationship between tagavors and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of feudal lord and a serf. Peasants were often allowed to own land, were free and owned property."
 sygnakhs:1 "Sygnakhs"
 sygnakhs_desc:1 "Sygnakhs are military structures in Armenia for recruiting organizations, fortification systems, signal beacons and logistical support.

 geo_legacy_of_saint_nino_desc:1 "Georgia has one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, tracing its roots back to the Christianization of the region by Saint Nino, over a Millennium ago. Through the centuries the Georgian church has served as an increasingly unifying force in all Georgian states up to the unification of the country under the Bagrationi dynasty. From then on the Church has served as a central element in Georgian culture, in the face of Byzantine as well as Mongol or Persian influence. With the splintered loyalties within Georgia today the Church still has an important role to play as a unifying force against outsiders."

 qar_governor_of_azerbaijan_desc:1 "While many of our military campaigns against our Mongols overlords have given us valuable experience perhaps the most important gain was the title of Mongol-governor, given by the Jalayirids to Jahan Shah in order to help him pacify our people. What they did not realize is that this allows us to claim the legitimacy of the Mongols, who once defeated and conquered all states in the Caucasus. This newfound honor gives us a platform to build a lasting hold over the Caucasus, Azerbaijan and perhaps one day even Persia."

The mountains, deserts, plains and forests of the Caucasus and Iran require quick adaptation to local circumstances and a keen eye for strategic and tactical advantages.

 sme_atabegs_of_samtskhe_desc:1 "Samtskhe is in many ways a cultural and religious borderland, right where Orthodoxy and Eastern Christianity meet in the Caucasus, and where the Turks, Armenians, Mongols, Greek and Turkomans mix and live side by side. This has been the source of many conflicts in our past but it has also made our state different than other parts of Georgia. The fact that our rulers use the Turkic title Atabey, is but one sign of how different we are to the other parts of Georgia."
 sme_proactive_diplomacy:1 "Proactive Diplomacy"
 sme_proactive_diplomacy_desc:1 "While a part of Georgia Samtskhe has been largely independent for centuries. This has required a constant awareness of politics in Georgia as well as very active diplomacy with the larger empires that we have bordered. From the Mongols and Ilkhans to the Qara Qoyunlu, our rulers have always made sure that we have a direct channel with those that have the most power. Likewise, when we have played an active necessary part in the internal politics of the kingdom of Georgia, both meddling in succession struggles, and allying with the royal dynasty when it suits us. We would do well to uphold this tradition for the future of our small state depends upon it. Let it never be said that we have done too little or acted without sufficient intelligence."

 sme_fortresses_of_samtskhe_desc:1 "Our country is a mountainous borderland that has acted as a frontier against foreign invaders of Georgia many times. For this reason, we have learned to build strong fortresses and be ready for drawn-out defensive warfare. This legacy is one we must strive at all costs to uphold, the fortresses of Samtskhe must be well maintained, manned, and supplied for foreign invaders are not a possibility but a certainty."
 sme_independent_ambitions:1 "Independent Ambitions"
 sme_independent_ambitions_desc:1 "Be they Zoroastrian or Christian, Georgian, Turkic or Iranian, Samtskhe has often had to bow to foreign kings and shahs. In order to create an enduring state and economy, we need to build our own institutions, that last regardless of who desires our lands at the moment. Let us issue our own coinage and laws as well as patronize our own theologians and writers."

However, the constant raids of nomadic tribesmen on these routes means that many now doubt the safety of our roads.

It serves as a symbol of Khivan tolerance and acceptance."

Instrumental in the day-to-day business of the Indian Ocean trade this merchant organization is now both wealthy and powerful. From the Tamil coasts and the ports of the Kingozi trading cities to the Egyptian port cities past the Gulf of Aden, Sultans, nobles and commoners alike come to buy exotic goods or borrow money for their projects from the Karimis.\nThis organization has lately come to take a very active interest in our state and we only stand to gain from cultivating our relationship with it further."

 dlh_afghan_nobility_desc:1 "Converts to the Manichaean faith the Pashtuns have been a crucial part of the Shahdom's nobility since its formation in the early 13th century. These nobles have contributed to the Shahdom's successful military campaigns against the Vagehla of Gujarat and Deva of Bengal. Yet they have also been a hindrance due to their aid of pretender shahs which have resulted in civil wars. Even though at times they have been a political hindrance, their martial skills are beyond question."
 dlh_suppress_rebellion:1 "Elevate the casteless"
 dlh_suppress_rebellion_desc:1 "The Prophet Gautama Buddha has condemned the caste system for which he considered as an unjust system. He pointed to the innate truth that there exists cruel and wicked people as well as kind and virtuous people in every caste. This innate truth can be seen as well in merit and skill. By elevating the castless based on merit and giving them a place in our kingdom we can gain their loyalty while further decreasing the power of the nobility."
 dlh_expansionism:1 "Yamagnatic Administration"
 dlh_expansionism_desc:1 "Residing in our Realm the Yamag has played a crucial role in the administration of the Shahdom. As the successor of the final Prophet Mani Hayya, the Yamag is the head of the Manichaean Church. At times this relationship between the Shah and the Yamag has been tense and has resulted in internal conflict. Even with these periods of internal conflict his importance can not be underestimated. If we can further integrate his role in our administration it will elevate the legitimacy of our realm above the other Shahs."
 dlh_textile_innovation:1 "Promote Innovation in Textile Production"
 dlh_textile_innovation_desc:1 "The thriving textile industry in Delhi makes our nation a center of technological innovation for the industry. As early adopters of the cotton gin and worm gear roller, we know the importance of staying ahead of the curve in these matters. We must now ensure that the spinning wheel is adopted as widely as possible by heavily investing in its production and use."
 dlh_reconquest:1 "Re-integrate Former Provinces"
 dlh_reconquest_desc:1 "When our ancestors first arrived in Doab the region was divided amongst various Rajputs. This division allowed the early Shahs of Delhi to unite the Indo-Gangetic plains. The following century would see the Shahdom reach its height uniting all of Northern India. However, this unity would not last as the following decades would see multiple civil wars, raids from Kartids and an invasion from the Tibetan Kingdom. The Manichaean realms are now divided and have become vulnerable from outside threats. Let us restore this past glory of the shah by bringing these territories back under the authority of Delhi."

These campaigns resulted in the introduction of new military tactics and technology into the Malwa Plateau. Our ancestors would take advantage of these ideas and would result in the conquest of the Yadava Rajahnate.

These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in faraway ports. We must not take these traders for granted, however. By establishing ports and villages that are free of taxes and tolls we may persuade domestic and foreign traders alike to keep their bases of operation in our lands rather than that of our neighbors. Let us create such sanctuaries and watch the merchants flock to our cities."

Recent times have also seen increasing migration into our lands from the north, many of these new subjects tend to settle in the drier regions where they won't have to compete with existing settlements. In many cases, these regions might also be quite productive given that adequate investments into canals and water tanks could be made.

Apart from the indigenous Telugu, Kannada and Tamil groups Maratha horsemen, Persian or Turani Horsemen, Turkoman gunners, Mavales and Berads are all competing to serve in our armies. Among other things this competition means that hiring these groups is cheaper than it might otherwise have been."

While taking control over all these areas would be an arduous and lengthy process we might instead attempt to insert people loyal to us in the local hierarchies. With a royal mandate to create, improve and defend fortified settlements these new leaders would rely on authority bestowed on them by the state rather than ancient traditions. These new power holders will allow us to exert a much greater deal of control over our hinterlands and will prove a much more reliable source of troops than the old chiefdoms ever did."

Grand temple cities such as Marakkanam or Tanjore bear witness of extensive royal patronage. Indeed in recent times, these temple complexes have been growing even more grand and monumental, with South Indian temple complexes in many ways dwarfing those that can be found in northern India. In order to live up to the expectations placed upon us as rulers, we should patronage the temple communities in our lands and make sure that they adequately communicate the greatness of our dynasty."

Royal dynasties have patronized the religion, forming a common community with Hindus. Manichean invasions from the east, by Juganavids in the eleventh century and Wišnaspids in the twelth century, oppressed the Jaina community, vandalizing temples or converting them into Manichaean, as well as having burned Jaina libraries.

He overthrew down Mesopotamians, our old overlord to the north - the Armenian kingdom, their Egyptian allies, and the Greek holdings in the Middle East.\nOur time is once again one of religious turmoil with Nestorianism on the rise in Persia.

It is a mild and wet area, ideal for rice cultivation, with some of the oldest cities in the Iranian region. In times of war and upheaval Tabarestan is also often left at peace due to its protected position, and therefore boasts a large population compared to its size.

Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tapuristani coast there’s everything from Manichaeans and Zoroastrians to Nestorians, Miaphysites and Orthodox Christians. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war.

Often provincial governors will have to act quickly and with little chance to ask the center for instruction. It is essential that we have governors that we can trust both in terms of loyalty and ability.\nThe Timurid and Genghisid practice of putting the princes of the dynasty in such positions would likely serve us well. Every governor will be motivated to do the most of his position if he has hope to inherit the throne himself."

The key to survival in a dangerous world is not to surrender as soon as we are threatened, but it is also not to go looking for a fight that we don’t yet know who will win.

Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."

 sis_loyal_service_desc:1 "Sakastan’s time as a great empire may have been short but for centuries we have provided armies and leaders for the wars of Ilkhans, Karts, and even Timur. We should proudly preserve this tradition of service in our ranks as we make good use of the experience earned in the war of foreign powers."
 sis_saffarid_legacy:1 "Sakastani Resilience"
 sis_saffarid_legacy_desc:1 "Through our continued survival in the rough political climate of Persia, we demonstrated the strength that the people of Sakastan can possess. We should strive to emulate our Saffarid ancestors and remember that what looks like a distant province is actually the seeds of empire."
 sis_subjugation_of_tribes:1 "Subjugation of the Tribes"
 sis_subjugation_of_tribes_desc:1 "We control the forts and cities of Sakastan but in the mountains, hills and deserts that surround our state there are many tribes that lead a life almost entirely independent of our rule. We must subdue the tribes of these areas both in order to safeguard the peace in the lowlands and to extend our control over the highlands."
 sis_chronicles_of_sistan:1 "Chronicles of Sakastan"
 sis_chronicles_of_sistan_desc:1 "Through the centuries the dynasties of Sakastan have often found it wise to chronicle their own history as rulers of the province. This is a wise tradition that we should follow. Unlike them however we would do well to first compile all old histories of Sakastan so that we might create a new great work over the history of this kingdom from ancient times until today."
 sis_scholars_of_sistan:1 "Scholars of Sakastan"
 sis_scholars_of_sistan_desc:1 "Sakastan was once a center of culture, religion and scholarship. We should once again aspire to these qualities. By inviting scholars, founding schools, churches and charities we can restore the reputation of what once was, to the general benefit of our people and government."
 sis_overland_trade_routes:1 "Overland Trade Routes"
 sis_overland_trade_routes_desc:1 "We control important points on the overland routes between Afghanistan, Khwarasan and Iran. Lands that have historically often been considered unsafe by traders, with some daring to cross them despite the dangers that they pose. We should create a network of well guarded stopping points for caravans and do our utmost to protect any traders in our realm. In this way we can encourage the transit trade to grow and attract more wealth to our realm."

 #Transoxania Ideas
 trs_threshold_of_paradise_desc:1 "While he was far from the first conqueror to come to Transoxiana, Timur made the region the center of his Empire and he brought treasures, artists, builders and artisans from the entire world to his great capital in Samarkand. We must strive to uphold this legacy, and continue to embellish this foremost jewel among cities. From the courts in Carthage to the palaces in Beijing everyone shall covet the gilded city on the Silk Road."

 land_of_ambushers:1 "Land of Ambushers"
 land_of_ambushers_desc:1 "Such is the geography of Arberia, filled with fertile lowlands and hills, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocky terrain. For centuries the Arberian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. But this must change; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. Unfriendly armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs."
 albanian_tolerance:1 "Arberian Tolerance"
 albanian_tolerance_desc:1 "Due to Turbulence in the region, the lands, and peoples of Arberia have found themselves ruled by many different overlords. Because of these many overlords, the Arberians have grown to become very accepting and tolerant of Foreigners. Arberia is one of the very few places where different followers of Christianity, both Orthodox, and Catholic, manage to live side by side in complete peace."
 kingdom_of_albania:1 "Kingdom of Arberia"
 kingdom_of_albania_desc:1 "For ages our lands have been divided and ruled by the foreigners. Our people never had the desire or opportunity to create their own state, ruled by Arberians. But the tide of history is changing. As the mighty empires around us fall, and their influence over us dwindles we have the opportunity to throw off the chains that bind us down and forge our own destiny."
 hit_and_run:1 "Hit and Run"
 hit_and_run_desc:1 "Arberia is not a particularly large or powerful country. That doesn't mean that we won't fight when foreign invaders come to steal our lands. We have centuries of experience fighting off invaders and a fantastic understanding of how to best use our lands terrain to our advantage when fighting off these invaders. We don't follow traditional military tactics and march our men into valleys to have them face the enemy head-on we take to the hills, confuse the enemy, use our infantry to lure them, while our hidden cavalry flanks their exposed rear. Before they realize what had hit them, we vanish into thin air, waiting for the next time they march into our home."
 land_of_eagles:1 "Land of the Eagles"
 land_of_eagles_desc:1 "The day when the Kastrioti first raised our flag, emblazoned with the double-headed eagle, the myth, and our nation, was born. The Black Eagle still flies, and will continue to do so as long as Arberia exists."
 break_the_princes:1 "Break The Power Of Princes"
 break_the_princes_desc:1 "Our Land was divided and ruled by local princes, who were preoccupied with their own advancement. If we want to create a modern state, we must rid ourselves of these princes and impose a single central will and rule to help guide our people towards a brighter future."

 #Bosnian Ideas
 empower_bosnian_nobility:1 "Empower Bosnian Nobility"
 empower_bosnian_nobility_desc:1 "History of medieval Bosnia has been one of everlasting balance between its rulers and their nobles. Pressured from the outside by both Rome and Bulgaria eager to conquer Bosnian lands, in the past rulers of Bosnia have had to proclaim themselves nominally both Catholic and Orthodox, in order to prevent crusades against their domains. But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church. This meant that ruling Bosnia was a perpetual game of balance, one that only masters of this game could play and live to tell. In this game of thrones, you either win or you die."

 #Bulgar Ideas
 bul_idea_1:1 "Confirm The Bulgarian Boyars"
 bul_idea_1_desc:1 "As was the norm for Slavic people in Eastern Europe, the institution of Boyar aristocracy was common among Bulgarians in virtually all iterations of their state. Now, with our people free, we must renew the old traditions and structure our society as it once was."
 bul_idea_3:1 "Unity Before Feuds"
 bul_idea_3_desc:1 "Now that we are free again, we must make sure that Bulgarian nobility never put their own petty squabbles above the common interest of our people. Never again will Bulgaria fall into the night! United we shall reclaim the place which is rightfully ours."
 bul_idea_5:1 "Reform The Bulgarian Church"
 bul_idea_5_desc:1 "The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the first Orthodox Slavic autocephalous Church. Once the source of great pride and power it was degraded during the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria and its decay continued during our internal struggles. Free once again, the Bulgarian people will find the Bulgarian Church the chief pillar of their society once again. As it once was so shall it be again."
 bul_idea_6:1 "Military Flexibility"
 bul_idea_6_desc:1 "Bridging the Steppe world, the Orthodox world and Western Europe; Bulgaria faces military challenges like few other countries in Europe. Not only does it have to remain competitive against numerous would-be conquerors, it has to retain its expertise in fighting in virtually every terrain type - from steppes, to plains and lowlands to forests, hills and mountains. Our ancestors never feared these challenges, they rose to face them with legendary success and grace, and so shall we once again."
 bul_idea_7:1 "Lessons from Rome"
 bul_idea_7_desc:1 "The golden age of Rome is over. Just as the once mighty empire has fallen, its Greek successors seem to move in the same direction. It is now up to Bulgaria to use our position in Europe at the heart of one of the continent's largest trade route intersections, as well as our royal ties to the Byzantine throne and claim the legacy of Rome. Let other claimants fear the new Bulgarian Tsardom, risen from ashes like a phoenix."

 #Cilli Ideas
 cli_political_manoevring:1 "Political Maneuvering"
 cli_political_manoevring_desc:1 "Our House is no stranger to political intrigues. From the earliest rise of the Counts of Cilli to the influence Ulrich enjoyed over the powerful nations of Austria and Bulgaria, we have been able to punch above our weight on the regional scene via smart political and diplomatic maneuvering."
 cli_border_wars:1 "Border Wars"
 cli_border_wars_desc:1 "At the intersection between Austria, Bulgaria, Venice and the Byzantines, our lands are often a battlefield for competing great powers. In order to protect ourselves from the calamities of war, we have been forced to take extra measures for the defense of our people."

 #Dalmatian Ideas

 DAL_kingdom_of_dalmatia_desc:1 "When the Byzantines failed to protect the Principalities, the cities of Dalmatia agreed that we must seek the protection of either the Venetians or the Bulgars. Under Venice, we maintained our royal titles. The independent principalities were governed by our own people, but the Kingdom of Dalmatia existed under union with the Republic of Venice. Whether under a King of our own, or a foreigner, the stability granted by our dual-government system shall keep the people pacified and productive."

 #Herzegovina Ideas
 HRZ_saint_sava:1 "Saint Sava"
 HRZ_saint_sava_desc:1 "The official title of our nation is the Duchy of Saint Sava. We adopted this title to distance ourselves from the Bogomilist Kingdom of Bosnia, and to venerate the great Saint Sava who had been a unifying icon for many of the different peoples of the Balkans. Saint Sava was a count of Hum who abandoned his royal titles to become a monk on Mount Athos, which he would then transform into an important religious center for the Orthodox church with the establishment of the Monastery of Hilandar. Saint Sava represents to us our dedication to the Orthodox church and is the icon that separates us from the Bosnian Kingdom."
 HRZ_ottoman_accommodation:1 "Accommodation with the Cuman Turks"
 HRZ_ottoman_accommodation_desc:1 "While many other nations resist the growing power of the Cuman Turks, many nobles in Herzegovina flock to the Turks for support in overthrowing the tyrannical regime in Bosnia. Perhaps by embracing the rise of the Cumans, we may be able to manipulate their nobility and armies into fighting for our cause and advancing our interests in the Balkans."
 HRZ_shifting_allegiances:1 "Shifting Allegiances"
 HRZ_shifting_allegiances_desc:1 "Our Herceg has bent the knee to Italians, Cumans, Bosnians, and Serbians. We understand that the winds of change and fortune favor those with a silver tongue and flexible foreign policy. We have never been a great empire or kingdom, but we have continued to protect our interests both as an independent nation and subject of foreign powers through our flexible diplomacy and fierce negotiation tactics. By keeping our ears open to new diplomatic opportunities, we shall continue to protect our interests in the inconstant landscape of Mediterranean politics."

 #Moldavian Ideas
 moldavia_metropoly:1 "Metropolis of Moldavia"
 moldavia_metropoly_desc:1 "Moldavian Orthodoxy proved resistant to foreign influences, it survived through the Mongol invasion and rejected Transylvanian and Polish Catholic missionaries. The Metropolis of Moldavia, the autonomous Orthodox church of the realm, doesn't just work tirelessly to preserve the Orthodox faith, its churches and monasteries are also centers of learning, art and culture."

 #Ragusan Ideas
 patronage:1 "Patronage"
 patronage_desc:1 "Our maritime affairs and land trading has significant success under the patronage of Constantinople. By paying them a symbolic tribute we can maintain our independence and receive trading benefits. Historically, in 1481 Ragusa passed into Byzantine protection by paying an increased tribute of 12.500 ducats. For all other purposes, Ragusa was virtually independent."

 skilled_commanders:1 "Skilled Commanders"

 scorch_the_land_and_poison_the_wells:1 "Scorch the Lands and Poison the Wells"
 scorch_the_land_and_poison_the_wells_desc:1 "In the wooded Dacian plains only the natives know how to live off the land. No enemy will harvest a Dacian crop or drink water from a Dacian well and live to fight another day!"
 latin_island:1 "Latin Island"
 latin_island_desc:1 "It's been a long time since we were cut off from our Latin brothers. None of our neighbors speaks our language and few honor our traditions, but we still cherish our Latin heritage."
 rom_peasant_soldiers:1 "Peasant Soldiers"
 rom_peasant_soldiers_desc:1 "Dacian soldiers need very little when defending their homeland. They are not mercenaries, but rather peasants defending their homes - as long as they have food and weapons, salaries are of little importance."
 phanariote_traders:1 "Phanariote Traders"
 phanariote_traders_desc:1 "The Phanariotes have brought many ills to the Danubian Principalities, but no one can deny their abilities as traders. Their trade connections with Constantinople serve us well."
 phanariote_taxes:1 "Phanariote Taxes"
 phanariote_taxes_desc:1 "The Greek Phanariotes have brought with them from Constantinople a new system for collecting taxes. Our tax revenue has increased dramatically."

 #Serbian Ideas

 code_of_laws_desc:0 "A compendium of translations of Greek Byzantine books of law and great works of ancient philosophy to the Serbian language was issued by Stephen Dusan on 21st of May 1349 in Belgrade. It served as an inspiration for Serbia's very first Code of Laws."
 bastion_of_orthodoxy:1 "Bastion of Orthodoxy"
 bastion_of_orthodoxy_desc:1 "As the northern Balkan without resistance bowed to the apostate church in Rome, or the heretical teachings of Bogomil, Serbia shall serve as the last Balkanite bastion of Orthodoxy, the continuation of the Eastern Christian civilization."
 balkan_hajduks:1 "Balkan Hajduks"
 balkan_hajduks_desc:1 "Unlike their northern counterparts in Bulgaria, Hajduks in Serbia and neighboring Balkan lands have earned a more infamous reputation. These men lived the hard life of brigands, always in danger, always on the move: preying on poorly defended roads, ambushing Cuman tax collectors and merchants. However, during wars, these experienced, tough men often filled the ranks of Serbian armies, providing excellent - if a bit undisciplined - infantry."

 #Transylvanian Ideas
 unio_trium_nationum:1 "Unio Trium Nationum"
 unio_trium_nationum_desc:1 "Unio Trium Nationum was an alliance established in 1438 by the three free Transylvanian Estates. The orthodox Bulgarian nobility, the Saxon merchants, and the free military Szeklers, who are mainly recruited from the Magyars. The union was a pact directed against the peasantry, many of whom were catholic and Dacians. This alliance would have a long lasting and unexpected impact on the history of our people."
 transylvanian_saxons:1 "Transylvanian Saxons"
 transylvanian_saxons_desc:1 "In the 12th century the Bulgarian Kings invited Germans to settle and defend the relatively sparsely populated Transylvanian region.

 #Austrian Ideas
 imperial_ambitions:1 "Imperial Ambition"
 imperial_ambitions_desc:1 "The fall of the House of Hohenstauffen in 1250 led to chaos in the Empire and the Golden Bull of 1356 legalized anarchy by calling a constitution. However, since the time of Ottokar II the Imperial title was firmly in the hands of the Bohemian crown, a feat only possible with his power base in Austrian crownlands. This gives the Austrian nobility a unique position in the empire. Austria must use it's influence on the emperor to reform the Empire to make it Holy, Roman and an Empire once more."

 #Corfu Ideas
 cep_frankokratia:1 "Frankokratia"
 cep_frankokratia_desc:1 "Following the chaos of the early twelth century, some parts of formerly Byzantine possessions fell into the hands of Latin Franks and Italians. Ever since the Ionian Islands have been ruled by Neapolitan and Venetian families, even after the Byzantine reconquest of the islands. Over time Italian customs and language has become more and more ingrained with our native ones and under foreign rule we have managed to become one of the few bridges between east and west."
 cep_angelokastroi:1 "Castles of the Angels"
 cep_angelokastroi_desc:1 "In constructing the Angelokastro, or Castle of the Angels, the Byzantines realized the importance of fortifying these islands. The Frank and Italians who came after them have continued to construct a great number of castles and forts here and with so many greedy eyes resting on our possessions we would do well to continue that tradition. Let us build a strong system of forts and fortified ports so that we can use the environment of these beautiful yet rugged islands to our advantage. Italian, Arberian or Greek, anyone wishing to conquer what is ours should know that there is a high price to be paid."
 cep_entrepot_of_eastern_med:1 "Entrepôt of the Eastern Mediterranean"
 cep_entrepot_of_eastern_med_desc:1 "Ionian sailors have always frequented ports from the Black Sea to Egypt and we have long profited from our position between east and west. With the development of our navy and the growth of our economy, however, local merchants have increasingly come to organize themselves in joint companies to invest in these trading ventures. Some families now control hundreds of small ships that regularly call the ports of Macedonia and Anatolia, Crete, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt and the many trading ports of the Italian Peninsula. We must do what we can to further encourage these entrepreneurs by abolishing hindering rules, regulations and tariffs and accommodating their trade."

 #Cypriote Ideas
 king_of_jerusalem:1 "Accidental Independence"
 king_of_jerusalem_desc:1 "In 1412, the turkic Aq Qoyunlu - called the White Sheep - took advantage of the ongoing Egyptian civil war, and stormed into the Delta, taking the region in mere months, and eventually even Alexandria. Only the unlikely victory of Amun III in Memphis prevented the downfall of the whole nation. Nevertheless, this conflict split off our island from the rest of Egypt, and we soon found ourselves isolated from our old masters, leaving us in a state of accidental independence. Despite everything we have never forgotten our oath of allegiance to the Pharaoh, and should he ever call upon us, we are ready to answer."
 frankish_crusaders:1 "Last Egyptian Bastion"
 frankish_crusaders_desc:1 "It's not a coincidence that the Aq Qoyunlu stay determent on conquering our island, despite not have anything even closely resembling a navy. The know, that our island will be critical for any Egyptian attempt on retaking the Delta. The spirit of Egyptian rule is still strong in us, and the last officially appointed governor has made an oath, that we shall seize at least some of the Egyptian coastline for our old masters. Let's prove we still have that fire in us."
 commandaria_wine:1 "Commandaria Wine"
 commandaria_wine_desc:1 "In the aftermath of the Mongol Invasion, the Byzantine emperor held a contest to determine the greatest wine in the world. Does it shock anyone that our Commandaria proved the Apostle of Wines in this greatest of competitions? Commandaria is ancient and just as tasty as it was hundreds of years ago. Even the Muslims of Arabia have developed a taste for it, despite supposedly refraining from alcohol."
 lusignan_diplomacy:1 "Island of Diplomacy"
 lusignan_diplomacy_desc:1 "During the time of Egypto-Byzantine coordination our island became an important meeting point for diplomats, monarchs and generals to plan their next step in shaking off the mongol yoke. Even today, with Egypt nearly destroyed, our island is one of the few places, where meetings between the formerly foremost powers of the east still can take place."
 cypriot_fortifications:1 "Cypriot Fortifications"
 cypriot_fortifications_desc:1 "Many, many powers have threatened Cyprus over the centuries, and neither the Greeks and the Egyptians had plans to make it easy for them. Everywhere you look, this island is fortified with the finest examples of Medieval castles and fortifications, proof that we are here to stay, to the dismay of anyone, be it the Turks, the Cappadocian or overly enthusiastic Greek nationalist."
 repel_the_corsairs:1 "The Stranded Fleet"
 repel_the_corsairs_desc:1 "After the Aq Qoyunlu managed by trickery and shameless treachery to occupy the Delta, and the rest of the Egyptian coast, nearly the whole Egyptian fleet set sail, for the last remaining free port - Cyprus. Now, despite our small size, our navy is one of the strongest in the whole Mediterranean, and we plan to put it to good use."
 raid_turkish_commerce:1 "Raid Turkish Commerce"
 raid_turkish_commerce_desc:1 "To support the whole Egyptian fleet on our own, has proven to be unmanageable for our small country, but we found a way out of this predicament, and stubled upon a valuable strategy. We can utilize our critical position in the Eastern Mediterranean to launch unrestricted raiding on Aq Qoyunlu vessels and trading posts and reap the economic rewards of their stolen wealth. Pirates may be the enemies of all nations, but privateers are merely contracted businessmen, right?"

 #Epirus Ideas

 epi_chronicle_of_the_toco_desc:1 "The Chronicles of Epirus details the history of our region, our rulers, our ties to the Empire, and our conquests of the surrounding lands. We should have it published in a simple form of Greek so all people can read and appreciate it."

A feat non of them - with the exception of Rome - every accomplished. As an independent Greek state it is our duty and our heritage to strengthen our control over this trade rather than ever allow others to grow rich from our strategic position."

 maritime_state_desc:1 "Since ancient time, our forefathers lived with and off the the sea and from the sea our power comes even today.

 legacy_of_crusaders:1 "Legacy Of The Antiquity"
 legacy_of_crusaders_desc:1 "Even though today many think, the Peloponnese or Macedonia were the cradle of the Greek civilization, they are all wrong.

 archipelago_feudalism:1 "Archipelago Feudalism"
 archipelago_feudalism_desc:1 "Over the centuries many western merchants and their families came to the islands and there was a rather unique meeting of civilizations: the Byzantine pronoia system of administration met head-on with Western European concept of feudalism. Something strange and beautiful happened at that point: it all mixed and matched together, creating a unique blend of Eastern and Western traditions, a system that works perfectly for both Greeks and Latins."
 latin_roots:1 "Western Connections"
 latin_roots_desc:1 "In the rest of Greece it seems like time has come to a standstill, while Italy goes through the Renaissance with technological progress like never before, many of these new and sometimes dangerous, yet often brilliant, ideas reach us. Solely us, with our unique connections to the west, have managed to adopt these innovations."
 naxian_ambitions:1 "Naxian Ambition"
 naxian_ambitions_desc:1 "Even though the Byzantine Empire - our old overlords - still exists, it seems like it has lost all of its glory and splendor, but its proud legacy still lives on through us.

To secure our position, a military expedition was decided against the independant duchy of Tarraco, the region was quickly subdued and integrated.

 gal_santiago_y_cierra_desc:1 "Established during the first Imwehhden invasion of Iberia, the Holy Order of Saint James would play a pivotal role in defending the Iberian Peninsula from Heretical Berber raiders. As defenders of the true Christian faith, they would take part in the 3rd and 4th crusade and aid in the defense of the Peninsula once again during the second Imwehhden invasion of Iberia. Renowned as holy warriors of the cross, the Order would be invited into the lands Galacia by King Alfonso IV in order to protect defenseless pilgrims, who visit the chruch of the orders patron, from marauding bandits.

 end_of_fueros_desc:1 "We cannot allow the old laws of the land to fragment and disorder our state any longer. Modern and forward-thinking Navarra must centralize all the power with the government, rid of the remnants of the old laws and autonomies."

 #Montferrat Ideas
 MFA_savoyard_loyalty:1 "Savoyard Loyalty"
 MFA_savoyard_loyalty_desc:1 "We are rich and prestigious for a nation of our size, but we understand our place in this world and it is by the side of our fellow Piedmontese countrymen. We've been subject to German Emperors, French Kings, and even the Greeks, but ultimately we find ourselves coming back to the Savoyard. Perhaps if we perform the correct political maneuvers, we may even one day be the senior partner in our perpetual union with Savoy."
 MFA_byzantine_claimants:1 "Last True Heirs of Byzantium"
 MFA_byzantine_claimants_desc:1 "There were several marriages between the Komnenoi of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Aleramicis of Montferrat, including that of the marriage of Irene di Montferrat and Andronikos II Komnenos. Irene's marriage is what brought the Italian branch of the Byzantine royal family to Montferrat and created some sense of unity between the Holy Roman and the Eastern Roman Empires. With the passing of the last legitimate heir of the Imperial branch of the Komnenoi dynasty, the Byzantine Empire has once again fallen into a bloody civil war that has brought the realm to its knees. As the last legitimate members of the main Komnenoi branch, it has become the responsibility of Montferrat to restore the order within the Eastern Roman Empire and continue to assert the dignity and prestige of our ancient bloodline!"
