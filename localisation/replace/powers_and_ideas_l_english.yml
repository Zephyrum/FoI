 aju_expelling_the_infidel_desc:1 "We have received news that the cities of our Kingozi brethren to the South were sacked and plundered by the Lusitanians heretics.

 ant_tampon_tany_desc:1 "Much as we cherish our roots, we are completely isolated as the only Christian state on Madagascar.

 ant_sorabe:1 "Nochgraphe"
 ant_sorabe_desc:1 "Our ancestors brought a rich Coptic scribal tradition with them to this island that we have now begun to make use of to create texts in Malagasy.

 #Beta_Israel
 bti_builders_and_artists:1 "Builders and Artisans"
 bti_builders_and_artists_desc:1 "Our Christian and Pagan neighbors have declared that Jews may not hold land in their kingdoms. This has led to a number of our brothers and sisters in faith having adopted new vocations. Throughout Ethiopia, the Beta Israeli men work as builders while the women decorate castles and churches. By encouraging some of these men and women to settle in our lands, free of oppression, we can benefit from the narrow-mindedness of our neighbors."

 indian_ocean_melting_pot_desc:1 "Kingozi city states are always exciting affairs. You never know if you'll find an Omani seaman, a Gujarati captain, a Malay spice trader, or even a brave merchant from the mysterious Island of the Moon, Madagascar.

 recruit_the_unbelievers_desc:1 "Sadly, the people of the interior have not yet heard the word of God, but even unbelievers have faith in the power of the gold coin. The riches of our land may attract them to serve under our banner... perhaps someday it will even inspire them to live righteously."

 akk_turko_iranian_bureaucracy_desc:1 "For us, it is easy to conquer and keep conquered peoples under control. However, if we are to extract any form of revenue from our new subjects we will need to rely not only on our military elites.

 akk_expansive_diplomacy_desc:1 "Our realm lies at a crossroad between the empires of the Mediterranean and those of Greater Eran. In many ways this region is one of few friends and many enemies.

 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc:1 "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized extremist sects that many of the Turkomen warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of both the tribes and the extremist clergymen without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."

 akk_qanun_nama_ye_hasan_desc:1 "The source of a land's wealth is its population. The lands under our control have, however, suffered from centuries of warfare.

 #Mali Ideas
 reclamation_of_land_desc:1 "The Tinariwin doesn't stay in one place...it can wax and wane depending on rainfall, and the habitable belt known as the Agisymba we reside in can grow or shrink accordingly.

However, in good years, we might reclaim some of the marginal land from the Tinariwin and make it productive again."

 #Malagasy Ideas

 rum_king_of_the_east_and_west_desc:1 "Since the fall of Rûm the Turkish people have been divided, serving minor Beys from the Bosphorus to the mountains of Kurdistan. It was our duty to restore the legacy of the Seljuk Khans of Rûm and unite the Anatolian Turks. Our ambition however must be much higher than that. The Seljuk Turks once ruled one of the greatest empires known to man, it is evident to anyone who sees our empire that the restoration of this state is now our destiny, as is the reclamation of the Roman lands that were once ruled from what is now our heartland."
 rum_shahanshah:1 "Shahanshah"
 rum_shahanshah_desc:1 "The Empire of Rûm was not only an Anatolian state but also one that strongly honored the Persian traditions of kingship. Especially as the lands of Persia itself fell to the hands of Mongol conquerors. Under the Kayzers before us, Persianate culture blossomed, and Persian poets and scholars found patronage. Men such as Khurshid Ardehi, Qanaya Tahmasp, Ammanuel Vardanid, and Rumi himself made their homes under Rûm’s protection and the Kayzers themselves were versed in Persian literature and poetry.\nWe must cherish our Persian legacy as well as our Turkish and aspire to make our homeland a paragon of Persianate culture, the foremost of Christian nations."

We took refuge at the shores of the sea, built a new home in the lands around the Catara peninsula, and tried to compete with the muslim traders of Hormuz and Oman. Even with the Caliphate long gone, the Muslim desert tribes, such as the Jarwanids, Najd and Dawasir, now desire what is ours. While it is important that we embrace the maritime nature of our state we must never forget our Bedouin past, or other desert tribes could displace us from our refuge."

 alh_lord_of_the_eastern_bedouin_desc:1 "We have come a long way since we took control of Catara, Al-Haasa and Hofuf. We must however never forget that we would have lost our home to the muslims long ago, if it weren't for the powers that protected us. The great Horselords of the East, the Seljuk Khans came to our aide, in our darkest hour, drove back the Muslim forces, and ensured, that Al-Haasa would become the bastion of Nestorian Christendom that it is today."
 alh_fortify_the_coastline:1 "Fortify the coastline"
 alh_fortify_the_coastline_desc:1 "The trade cities of Eastern Arabia are where we earn our livelihood. The cities themselves however are vulnerable. Foreign ships might easily descend on the coastline and hold our traders hostage. This is how the Hormuzi and Omani constantly threaten us, and this is how the emerging trade powers of the West will likely do so in the future.\nWe would do well to build strong stone fortifications in our principal ports, so that we can protect the wealth of our merchants."
 alh_a_modern_navy:1 "A Modern Navy"
 alh_a_modern_navy_desc:1 "An increasing number of Western ships have been seen in the Persian gulf lately, and though they are fellow Christians, we can not be sure of their intentions. Should they turn out to be hostile to us, in order to battle this new enemy however we will need to build a new and modern navy. Let us hire seasoned shipbuilders from our Nestorian brothers in South of India, and also invite sailors from to settle in our country, that have already encountered the modern western vassals."
 alh_legacy_of_rahmah_ibn_jabir:1 "Legacy of Catara Treaty"
 alh_legacy_of_rahmah_ibn_jabir_desc:1 "Once the Seljuks saved us from loosing our independence, and forced conversion. For that we swore our unending loyalty to them, a promise that was made official in the Catara treaty. This treaty should have also been the first step on reuniting Arabia in the Name of Christ, but then the Seljuks were betrayed, and their empire fell. We still desire to reclaim Arabia and free it from the Muslim plight, even if we have to do it alone."

 #Mahra Ideas
 mhr_book_of_navigation_desc:1 "The skill and experience of our navigators is known from Menuthias to Timor, but we cannot risk trade secrets dying with a single man. We should have our best navigators compile a new handbook for navigation. Up to date and with no secrets kept, for the benefit of future generations of seamen."
 mhr_pilots_of_the_arabian_sea_desc:1 "We have sailed the waters of the Erythraean Sea for hundreds of years and few captains know the waters as well as we do. There are Mahri communities from the Kingozi cities of East Africa to the bustling suburbs of Memphis or Vahardasir. Our maritime heritage has made our sailors highly sought after not only to man ships, but also as valuable pilots to guide ships of all nations through treacherous or unknown waters."

We are strengthened by our faith and the mystical exaltation that allow us to perform extraordinary acts in the name of his radiant dynasty. The end is near, and it is time the world learn to follow the teachings of the Shedagani!"

 msy_swamp_warfare:1 "Swamp Warfare"
 msy_swamp_warfare_desc:1 "The area around the Arvand-Rud to the Persian gulf is a maze of rivers, swamps and islands that any invader will find very hard to control or even navigate. Using the landscape to our advantage has been the way of the Shedagani warriors since the inception of our state, and finding ways to make use of this experience as we expand will allow us to continue to defeat foes that would appear stronger than we are."
 msy_arabistan:1 "Beth Nahrain"
 msy_arabistan_desc:1 "The Shedagani message has always rung true to the righteous, but it especially has strong influence among the Babylonian tribes of Beth Nahrain and northern Arabia. The support that we enjoy from these tribes is a strength that we should not only put to good use both to rule but also expand our influence across the whole of Mesopotamia."
 msy_house_united:1 "A House United"
 msy_house_united_desc:1 "While our state has come a long way since its founding by Yohannan Bera Qayyoma, we are still carriers of his legacy, and his descendants are still of central importance to the Shedagani government. Over the years, however, his dynasty has grown and much time and, energy has been lost to intrigue, factionalism and plotting between the various branches and their many supporters. Let us settle these differences once and for all and establish a clear succession for who is head of the dynasty."

 msy_outward_pragmatism_desc:1 "Having friends is a necessity in a hostile world. Our religious convictions make it unlikely that anyone will consider us anything other than heretics, something that we can make hard to find partners among our neighbors.

 msy_sufis_shias_middle_east_desc:1 "There are countless mystical Christians in the lands of Mesopotamia and Eran that have led their lives in secret for centuries, waiting for the return of the Messiah. Even amongst the most Orthodox Christians, there are those wise from years of meditation who show a great interest in the new teachings of the Shedagani. Let us invite these men and women into our lands. Some will undoubtedly bring our theology further while others can help us develop the new lands that we now control."

 #Armenian Ideas
 melikdom_organization:1 "T’agavorut’yun Organization"
 melikdom_organization_desc:1 "As one of the few bastions of an independent Armenian state, Armenia was governed by feudal suzerains called tagavors, as the old nakharar system collapsed. The relationship between tagavors and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of feudal lord and a serf. Peasants were often allowed to own land, were free and owned property."
 sygnakhs:1 "Sygnakhs"
 sygnakhs_desc:1 "Sygnakhs are military structures in Armenia for recruiting organizations, fortification systems, signal beacons and logistical support. Usually each tagavor would have his own sygnakh, but larger sygnakhs are shared by different tagavors. Establishing such sygnakhs allows us to rally our troops more effectively."

 #Circassian Ideas
 merchants_of_genoa:1 "Merchants Of Crimea"
 merchants_of_genoa_desc:1 "Centuries ago the many Greeks arrived at our shores, coming from their home land to establish colonies and trade hubs. While the Tartar hordes broke the Greek hold over the region, the people mostly stayed, and integrated into our society. This opened up an entirely new market for our products."
 circassian_grain:1 "Circassian Grain Trade"
 circassian_grain_desc:1 "As our coastal settlements have shaken most of the Tartar influence the flow of people coming and going from the seas to our lands has increased. Slowly fishing villages has grown into booming trading towns and cities. This is an excellent market for all the grain we can produce."
 franciscan_missionaries:1 "Franciscan Missionaries"
 franciscan_missionaries_desc:1 "The many merchants arriving in our lands, have not only brought trade with them. Soon Catholic missionaries of the Franciscan Order from far away Italy came to our lands and a deal was struck with the Circassian nobility allowing the Catholic church to spread its religious influence over all Circassian lands."

 adyghe_beauty_desc:1 "The beauty of our women is well known, and their reputation has spread even to faraway lands. Many rulers of both the Christian and Eastern worlds would find their spouses among them."

 #Georgia Ideas
 geo_legacy_of_saint_nino:1 "Legacy of Saint Nino"
 geo_legacy_of_saint_nino_desc:1 "Georgia has one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, tracing its roots back to the Christianization of the region by Saint Nino, over a Millennium ago. Through the centuries the Georgian church has served as an increasingly unifying force in all Georgian states up to the unification of the country under the Bagrationi dynasty. From then on the Church has served as a central element in Georgian culture, in the face of Byzantine as well as Mongol or Persian influence. With the splintered loyalties within Georgia today the Church still has an important role to play as a unifying force against outsiders."

 #Qara Qoyunlu Ideas
 qar_black_sheep:1 "The Black Sheep"
 qar_black_sheep_desc:1 "We are the confederation of the Black Sheep. Our lineage goes back to the great Oghuz Khans and our warriors have made the world tremble. Once we bowed our heads to the Mongols and Ilkhans but we now stand independent and stronger than ever, ready to take on the leadership of all the Turkic clans of Eran, Anatolia and the Caucasus."
 qar_governor_of_azerbaijan:1 "Governor of Azerbaijan"
 qar_governor_of_azerbaijan_desc:1 "While many of our military campaigns against our Mongols overlords have given us valuable experience perhaps the most important gain was the title of Mongol-governor, given by the Jalayirids to Jahan Shah in order to help him pacify our people. What they did not realize is that this allows us to claim the legitimacy of the Mongols, who once defeated and conquered all states in the Caucasus. This newfound honor gives us a platform to build a lasting hold over the Caucasus, Azerbaijan and perhaps one day even Persia."
 qar_dynamic_warfare:1 "Dynamic Warfare"
 qar_dynamic_warfare_desc:1 "Our region has proven perilous for many invaders. The mountains, deserts, plains and forests of the Caucasus and Eran require quick adaptation to local circumstances and a keen eye for strategic and tactical advantages. Our prolonged warfare against other Turkoman federations and the Jalayirids have allowed us to perfect a dynamic form of warfare, mixing raids, grand maneuver warfare and pitched battles."
 qar_patron_of_iranian_culture:1 "Patron of Eranian Culture"
 qar_patron_of_iranian_culture_desc:1 "As conquerors of Northern Eran and Armenia we have inherited the cities and palaces of the great empires before us.

 #Samtskhe Ideas
 sme_atabegs_of_samtskhe:1 "Atabeys of Samtskhe"
 sme_atabegs_of_samtskhe_desc:1 "Samtskhe is in many ways a cultural and religious borderland, right where Orthodoxy and Eastern Christianity meet in the Caucasus, and where the Turks, Armenians, Mongols, Greek and Turkomans mix and live side by side. This has been the source of many conflicts in our past but it has also made our state different than other parts of Georgia. The fact that our rulers use the Turkic title Atabey, is but one sign of how different we are to the other parts of Georgia."
 sme_proactive_diplomacy:1 "Proactive Diplomacy"
 sme_proactive_diplomacy_desc:1 "While a part of Georgia Samtskhe has been largely independent for centuries. This has required a constant awareness of politics in Georgia as well as very active diplomacy with the larger empires that we have bordered. From the Mongols and Ilkhans to the Qara Qoyunlu, our rulers have always made sure that we have a direct channel with those that have the most power. Likewise, when we have played an active necessary part in the internal politics of the kingdom of Georgia, both meddling in succession struggles, and allying with the royal dynasty when it suits us. We would do well to uphold this tradition for the future of our small state depends upon it. Let it never be said that we have done too little or acted without sufficient intelligence."
 sme_fortresses_of_samtskhe:1 "Fortresses of Samtskhe"
 sme_fortresses_of_samtskhe_desc:1 "Our country is a mountainous borderland that has acted as a frontier against foreign invaders of Georgia many times. For this reason, we have learned to build strong fortresses and be ready for drawn-out defensive warfare. This legacy is one we must strive at all costs to uphold, the fortresses of Samtskhe must be well maintained, manned, and supplied for foreign invaders are not a possibility but a certainty."
 sme_independent_ambitions:1 "Independent Ambitions"
 sme_independent_ambitions_desc:1 "Be they Zoroastrian or Christian, Georgian, Turkic or Eranian, Samtskhe has often had to bow to foreign kings and shahs. In order to create an enduring state and economy, we need to build our own institutions, that last regardless of who desires our lands at the moment. Let us issue our own coinage and laws as well as patronize our own theologians and writers."
 sme_protect_trade_routes:1 "Protect the Trade Routes"
 sme_protect_trade_routes_desc:1 "Our position at the crossroads of Georgia, Anatolia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan also mean that a great number of traders seek to cross our lands. However, the constant raids of nomadic tribesmen on these routes means that many now doubt the safety of our roads. We must properly defend all roads and merchant inns in our lands, ensuring that the trade can safely flow into our state unhindered."

We were one of the main constituent parts of Genghis Khan's empire and the main political force in Eastern Europe and the Steppes for centuries. Born again, the Golden Horde will strive to forge the empire that was lost and unite the Hordes of Central Asia."
 glh_perso_mongol_administration:1 "Perso-Mongol Administration"
 glh_perso_mongol_administration_desc:1 "Our ancestors refined the Mongol administrative system over the centuries, but they were not shy of incorporating the ideas and methods of the cultures they subdued. Our system of administration is in part based on traditions dating back to the Great Genghis Khan himself and in part on what we have adopted from Persians and Christian bureaucrats in the lands conquered. If our reborn Golden Horde is to thrive and continue to expand we must be ready to build an empire on pragmatic adoption."

 glh_tatar_traditions_desc:1 "Our empire may no longer be ruled from horseback, but our armies still very much are. Over the centuries, we have stayed true to our origins, ensuring that few can match the skill of our riders.

 glh_secure_the_trade_routes_desc:1 "Not all riches in this world originate in the lands under our rule. Trade is the source of all wealth, and the Golden Horde has always protected merchants. By ensuring the safety of anyone who wishes to move goods throughout our country, we can ensure a steady stream of furs, Chinese craftsmanship, silk, spices, and other necessities to our cities. Whether they choose to sell their goods to us or not their mere presence will generate wealth for our people."
 glh_populating_the_steppes:1 "Populating the Steppes"
 glh_populating_the_steppes_desc:1 "Just as we bring destruction to our, enemies we must bring peace to the many who reside within our borders. Before the devastation of the civil war, Sarai and the Golden Horde cities were once the envy of the world. Let this be the model for all our cities. By upholding the internal peace and encouraging talented men and women from all over our empire to plan and populate new and great cities, we will tame the steppes."
 glh_religious_pragmatism:1 "Religious Pragmatism"
 glh_religious_pragmatism_desc:1 "Restraining and inflexible doctrine has never managed to win many followers among the Tatar hordes. When the Great Öz Beg Khan adopted Christianity, it was from the lowly merchants instead of zealous missionaries that the khan invited into our lands. Centuries of tradition and loyalty are what we would build our state upon. Religion has a part to play, but we would rather see our country thrive than fall apart in the struggle to ensure that all share a common faith."

Built by devout Muslims fleeing prosecution after the defeat of the Caliphate at the hands of the Persians, its columns are decorated with both traditional Islamic and Khwarezmian patterns. It serves as a symbol of Khivan tolerance and acceptance."

Sadly, however, a hereditary office is one that over time might stagnate and lack for innovation.\nBy reducing the number of inherited offices with each generation we can make sure that we reward not only loyalty, but also ability.

 karimis_desc:1 "For centuries, the Indo-Egyptian trade has been handled by Egyptian based groups of traders and captains known as the Karimis. Instrumental in the day-to-day business of the Indian Ocean trade, this merchant organization is now both wealthy and powerful. From the Tamil coasts and the ports of the Kingozi trading cities to the Egyptian port cities past the Gulf of Aden, Shahs, nobles, and commoners alike come to buy exotic goods or borrow money for their projects from the Karimis.\nThis organization has lately come to take a very active interest in our state and we only stand to gain from cultivating our relationship with it further."

One will go to the state itself to care for our rulers and the treasury, one will belong to the nobility and other powerholders, and the last third should be entirely dedicated to funding the needs of the Dewan.

 dlh_afghan_nobility_desc:1 "Converts to the Manichaean faith the Pashtuns have been a crucial part of the Shahdom's nobility since its formation in the early 13th century. These nobles have contributed to the Shahdom's successful military campaigns against the Vagehla of Gujarat and Deva of Bengal. Yet they have also been a hindrance due to their aid of pretender shahs which have resulted in civil wars. Even though at times they have been a political hindrance, their martial skills are beyond question."
 dlh_suppress_rebellion:1 "Elevate the casteless"
 dlh_suppress_rebellion_desc:1 "The Prophet Gautama Buddha has condemned the caste system for which he considered as an unjust system. He pointed to the innate truth that there exists cruel and wicked people as well as kind and virtuous people in every caste. This innate truth can be seen as well in merit and skill. By elevating the castless based on merit and giving them a place in our kingdom we can gain their loyalty while further decreasing the power of the nobility."

As the successor of the final Prophet Mani Hayya, the Yamag is the head of the Manichaean Church. At times this relationship between the Shah and the Yamag has been tense and has resulted in internal conflict. Even with these periods of internal conflict his importance can not be underestimated.

 dlh_reconquest:1 "Re-integrate Former Provinces"

The following century would see the Shahdom reach its height uniting all of Northern India. However, this unity would not last as the following decades would see multiple civil wars, raids from Kartids and an invasion from the Tibetan Kingdom.

 dec_legacy_of_bahmanis_desc:1 "During the mid 13th century the Shahdom of Delhi began to expand south of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. These campaigns resulted in the introduction of new military tactics and technology into the Malwa Plateau. Our ancestors would take advantage of these ideas and would result in the conquest of the Yadava Rajahnate. From them, we have inherited many of their institutions of the state, our courtly culture, and our religious traditions. We must demonstrate that we are their true successors by honoring these traditions."

These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in faraway ports. We must not take these traders for granted, however. By establishing ports and villages that are free of taxes and tolls we may persuade domestic and foreign traders alike to keep their bases of operation in our lands rather than that of our neighbors. Let us create such sanctuaries and watch the merchants flock to our cities."

Recent times have also seen increasing migration into our lands from the north, many of these new subjects tend to settle in the drier regions where they won't have to compete with existing settlements. In many cases, these regions might also be quite productive given that adequate investments into canals and water tanks could be made.

Among other things this competition means that hiring these groups is cheaper than it might otherwise have been."

While taking control over all these areas would be an arduous and lengthy process we might instead attempt to insert people loyal to us in the local hierarchies. With a royal mandate to create, improve and defend fortified settlements these new leaders would rely on authority bestowed on them by the state rather than ancient traditions. These new power holders will allow us to exert a much greater deal of control over our hinterlands and will prove a much more reliable source of troops than the old chiefdoms ever did."

Grand temple cities such as Marakkanam or Tanjore bear witness of extensive royal patronage. Indeed in recent times, these temple complexes have been growing even more grand and monumental, with South Indian temple complexes in many ways dwarfing those that can be found in northern India. In order to live up to the expectations placed upon us as rulers, we should patronage the temple communities in our lands and make sure that they adequately communicate the greatness of our dynasty."

For a thousand years, Gujarat has been the stronghold of the Jain community and faith, with many holy sites and temples. Royal dynasties have patronized the religion, forming a common community with Hindus. Manichean invasions from the east, by Juganavids in the eleventh century and Wišnaspids in the twelth century, oppressed the Jaina community, vandalizing temples or converting them into Manichaean, as well as having burned Jaina libraries. However, we have survived, adapted and prospered, using our connections with Jain communities across the world to serve as a hub for both faith and commerce."

 snd_makli_necropolis_desc:1 "The Makli Necropolis is home to the tombs of centuries of royalty, scholars, and renowned holy men of many faiths.

The new castes formed by these newcomers such as the Salagamas, Duravas, or Karavas have all come to occupy themselves with the new and developing sectors in our economy rather than the traditional agriculture which occupies most of our population."

 yor_encourage_coromandel_trade_desc:1 "The Coromandel Coast has always been a great source of wealth due to the major bustling ports with their many traders and merchants from far-away countries. One of the previous Kakatiya rulers of Andhra wisely kept regulations on the Coromandel trade to a minimum which resulted in the stimulated growth of their ports greatly. Let us enact similar policies which will reduce trading regulations and allow traders a freer rein."

However, in his dying breath, he changed his mind and made our forefather the sole heir to the Kakatiyan kingdom.

In order to keep our trade safe from those that would steal our wealth, we must be put constant pressure on foreign fleets, be they Christian, Chinese, or from one of the many Indianized kingdoms.

Rock fortresses such as this have served the Kurdish tribesmen for generations and we would do well to learn from their experiences. The value of well maintained castle cannot be overstated, this is as true on the banks of the Tigris as it was in the Grand city of Memphis, or the hills of Palestine."

 hsn_ayyubid_heritage_desc:1 "Our ancestors once ruled a great empire, spanning the entirety of Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, Egypt and Armenia. While not much remain of this empire our name still commands respect among the Kurdish tribes we now rule. If we can rally these warriors to our cause, we might yet strive to rebuild that which was taken from us during the Mongol invasion."

 hsn_righteousness_of_the_faith_desc:1 "Our great ancestor, Selahedînê, elevated our family to greatness through his utter unwillingness to compromise with the righteousness of his faith. He overthrew down Mesopotamians, our old overlord to the north - the Armenian kingdom, their Egyptian allies, and the Greek holdings in the Middle East.\nOur time is once again one of religious turmoil with Nestorianism on the rise in Persia.

Yet it is possible to travel through Baluchistan and Makran from Kapul to Sindh, and we know the passes and paths through the mountains and deserts. Let us open our routes to traders and tax them for our protection."

 #Caspian Ideas

 caspian_riches_of_tabarestan_desc:1 "Surrounded by mountains on all sides Tapuristan follow the entire Caspian coastline. It is a mild and wet area, ideal for rice cultivation, with some of the oldest cities in the Eranian region. In times of war and upheaval Tapuristan is also often left at peace due to its protected position, and therefore boasts a large population compared to its size. This relative peace and old settlements has also made all the countries of Tapuristan important stops on the Silk Road, allowing us to benefit from the wealthy Trans-Asiatic Trade networks."
 caspian_time_of_turmoil:1 "A Time of Turmoil"
 caspian_time_of_turmoil_desc:1 "All around us, great kingdoms are collapsing. We have seen have over the centuries have seen countless Persian rump states fighting over the destroyed remnants of their ancestral legacy. If our nation will ever survive this era of great turmoil, we must establish a strong army of our very own, manned by the local soldiers that for generations have seen foreign conquerors come and go. It is time we look not only to defend ourselves but to strike at those who will surely otherwise devour us."
 caspian_safe_haven:1 "A Safe Haven"
 caspian_safe_haven_desc:1 "This region has often been a safe haven for people of different cultures and religions. Priests, warlords or merchants can all find a place here. Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tapuristani coast there’s everything from Manichaeans and Zoroastrians to Nestorians, Miaphysites and Orthodox Christians. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war. We must build strong fortresses to guard the passes that lead through the mountains that protect us, and keep strong garrisons at hand to protect the freedom we enjoy."

Yet it is here, at the crossroads of Central Asia, Eran, and India, that many empires have chosen to base their capitals. Under Shah Yonandam I, the region has prospered in relative stability and, from the markets of Herat to the shrines of Sanabad, we have built a reputation as the home of both great scholars and thriving cities."

 kho_rein_in_the_turko_mongol_emirs_desc:1 "The majority of our armies are still made up of the tribesmen that the Great Khans brought with them to this region. By organizing these troops in a more centralized manner than his predecessor Shah Narsieh I was able to secure his rule over Persia. However, these reforms have also made these Turko-Mongol marzobans very powerful men in their own right. Where he was able to command their loyalty through personal gratitude and, marriages we need to win their support in more long term ways."
 kho_princely_appanages:1 "Princely Appanages"
 kho_princely_appanages_desc:1 "A realm as diverse and geographically divided as Khwarasan can be difficult to hold together. Often provincial governors will have to act quickly and with little chance to ask the center for instruction. It is essential that we have governors that we can trust both in terms of loyalty and ability.\nThe Kartid and Genghisid dynasties' practice of putting the princes of the dynasty in such positions would likely serve us well. Every governor will be motivated to do the most of his position if he has the hope to inherit the throne himself."
 kho_irrigation_network:1 "Irrigation Canals"
 kho_irrigation_network_desc:1 "Agriculture comes at great cost in Khwarasan, the land is dry and there are no major rivers to speak of. Our Persian administrators are suggesting that if our cities are to reach their full potential we will have to invest in a great number of irrigation works and canals. With enough water even the rarest fruits can be grown from Herat to Sanabad and we can build gardens to the envy of all of Asia."
 kho_dynastic_chronicles:1 "Dynastic Chronicles"
 kho_dynastic_chronicles_desc:1 "Khwarasan has a long history as a center of scholarly learning, and our hold over this land is new and untested.

The Silk Road passes through, connecting Samarkand with Eran and the Mediterranean, and is joined in Herat by the Grand Trunk Road from India.\nThis long journey is a perilous and arduous one for many merchants however. By vowing to protect all merchants passing through our lands, and constructing regular caravanserais along the trade routes, we can greatly limit the risks and likely attract even more wealth to our great cities"

In fact, the Zagros mountains have been seen as a barrier between Eran and Mesopotamia for centuries.

 lri_jadda_ye_atabak_desc:1 "When the Kingdom of Anshan ruled this region, they used their power to cut a great road out of the mountains, greatly improving the ease of which trade could be conducted across the Zagros while also getting their own cut for the upkeep.\nToday the Kingdom of Anshan is no longer, as Persian Shah Kambyses I crushed it in the 1420’s, but the road remains. We must learn of the Atabaks and not let their road go to waste. By continuing to ensure its upkeep, we ensure that we can provide a valuable service to our neighbors and that we will never go without money."

 lri_haven_for_dissenters_desc:1 "The nomadic life of most of our subjects can be enticing to some. There are many groups, both nomadic and sedentary, for which there is no longer room in the vast plains of Mesopotamia or the valleys of Eran. People who have found themselves on the losing side of wars, who have been cleared away to make way for irrigation, or who have been deemed too unruly to remain when central power was expanded.\nWe should open our arms to these people and allow them to settle as new tribes in our mountains. Nobody will be as determined to defend their new homes such as those who have lost everything"
 lri_popular_religion:1 "Popular Religion"
 lri_popular_religion_desc:1 "While we know all among our people are good Christians it is not always clear that the learned sages of the plains would agree with that assessment. Few here speak or read Syriac, and many live in relative isolation from the outside world. Between our veneration of the local saints, the veneration of Haft Râz-hâ (Seven guardian Archangels), and the prevalence of syncretic sects such as Yarsanism would likely strike the most learned of the Clergy as quite unsettling. Yet this openness to variety is also a strength, for it is hard to imagine a people we would have trouble integrating into our society due to religious concerns."

Our people are hard and strong, having endured a lifetime in rough terrain, defending their herds against raiders and withstanding the attacks of foreign invaders when necessary. Over the centuries, we have also acted as king-makers as our armies have helped various pretenders in the Persian realm.\nNow the time has come to rise for ourselves, to seize the lands around us, and to form an army able to destroy those of the sedentary weaklings."

 frs_diplomatic_prudence:1 "Diplomatic Prudence"
 frs_diplomatic_prudence_desc:1 "Where other regions have been quick to support new rising conquerors, or quick to surrender with armies outside of their walls, Pars has often favored a more careful and balanced approach. The key to survival in a dangerous world is not to surrender as soon as we are threatened, but it is also not to go looking for a fight that we don’t yet know who will win. As new claimants to supremacy in Persia come and go we will carefully consider our options. Our people will be here long after any newcomers are gone, regardless of if they win or lose their petty conflicts."

Instead she found the secret of wine and in little time it spread from the royal court.\nWine has been produced and consumed in Persia for millennia, but none can compete with those made from the excellent grapes cultivated on the terraced slopes of the Zagros mountains in Pars. The reputation of Shirazi wine has spread far beyond the borders and is greatly in demand even in India and Europe.\nWe must expand our irrigation system and do what we can to increase our wine production, while marketing our highly sought after goods on foreign markets."

Famous master painters and bookmakers have always settled in our cities and enjoyed our protection.\nThe Shirazi school can only blossom with lavish support to create more books, however, and that is something we must provide if we are not to be overshadowed by Indian or Azerbaijani bookbinders and painters."
 frs_integrate_the_qashqai:1 "Integrate the Qashqai"
 frs_integrate_the_qashqai_desc:1 "While Pars is home to many sedentary Persians, and great cities and industries, it is also populated by large groups of nomadic tribesmen. The Qashqai and other groups have often been at odds with the city dwellers, leading to expensive conflicts between the two that does not benefit the realm.\nWe must integrate the Qashqai and give them place in our cities while guaranteeing their rights to use land for grazing. In return we ask that our ruler will be consulted for the appointment of new Ilkhans, their traditional leaders."

Let us take inspiration from the great Empires before us and create a capital worthy to this name. We must expand and renovate every part of the capital, building new canals for irrigation, public baths, bazaars, city walls, squares, palaces, temples, universities and gardens.\nAll who wish should be allowed space to settle here for this will be the greatest capital man has ever seen!"

Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."

 arl_qizilbash_desc:1 "Whether they profess to be Mystical Christians or Orthodox Christianity, the belief in Jesus Christ is widespread among the Turkoman tribesmen of Eran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. The Pakaganids have quickly come to gain strong support among these groups and many are now flocking to their banners. Styling themselves 'Qizilbash' or 'Redheads', after their characteristic red hats, they could be the core of a new army, ready to fight and die for the head of the Pakaganids."
 arl_shiite_leadership:1 "Leader of all Christians"
 arl_shiite_leadership_desc:1 "Millenarian sects have begun to spring up all around the Eranian lands, but we know that our bishops are the only legitimate Christian rulers in the world. We must spread the word of the bishops of Ardabil and force any Nesotorian masters in the territory under our control to accept that they are but deputies for our messianic authority."

 arl_conversion_of_the_masses_desc:1 "For a long time, this region has been a heterodox mix of religions, with the honor of Angels, the devotion of Christ, and the Zoroastrian Shahs existing side by side. We must show those troubled the right way by clearly outlining what it is to worship properly and acting to limit the Zoroastrian influence of our enemies among at least the lower classes. Punishing those that do not comply if needed."

 arl_amili_mujtahids_desc:1 "The Ardabil region has always been a safe haven, the Patriarch of Nesotorian Church could flee to, if his position in Ctesiphon was threatend. Be it by Yazidi Kurds, Zoroastrian Persians or Pagan Mongols. The Mountains and hidden monasteries have over time been the refuge of many Patriarchs and often his whole congregation of bishops. This means that over time some of the religious legal and institutional framework of the chruch has seeped into our government, to better accommodate the chruch. And it has given us a special place in the heart of all Nestorians as the true guardians of the Patriarchate."
 arl_shahs_of_iran:1 "Shahs of Eran"
 arl_shahs_of_iran_desc:1 "What started as a religious sect in Ardabil is now ready to claim overlordship over all Eranian lands. The time has come to take our rightful place among the great nations of this world and the Persian Empires that came before us."

 srv_khalwati_order_desc:1 "The leader of the Nestorian Tanihayi lodge in Baku, Malko Yuhanon Bakuvi, is by far the most influential master of the order. This charismatic leader has grown the order from a small movement to have thousands of members. The influence of Yuhanon Bakuvi and his followers is great upon our state and their faith is tied to ours."

 srv_tribesmen_of_the_caucasus_desc:1 "Our people have a long and proud martial tradition, having fought Mongols, Khazars, Qizilbash and Tatars. Through learning from these experiences and absorbing their best qualities our armies have grown even stronger. In order to further our own ambitions in a time of turmoil, we must strive to be even stronger than those states that would come to subdue us."
 srv_persianate_patronage:1 "Persianate Patronage"
 srv_persianate_patronage_desc:1 "The Shirvan Shah’s were for centuries famous for their patronage of high Persian culture, arts, and poetry. The Eranian region has since been entirely transformed by emperors such as Narsieh or Jahan Shah, yet the Persian language and culture remain what binds this region together. Let us invite poets, scholars, and writers from all over the Persian world to our capital, and establish the fame of the Shirvan court once again."
 srv_caspian_trade:1 "Caspian Trade"
 srv_caspian_trade_desc:1 "Expensive goods from Italy, as well as Bengal, easily find their way to our Caspian ports as the Caspian Sea is a major transit point for long range trade through Baku, Sarighsin, and the cities of Tapuristan. We must see that these traders have all that they need, both in terms of safety and comforts and to support our own merchant community so that we may continue to draw upon the wealth of the world."

 srv_shirvani_architecture_desc:1 "Since the reign of Abrohom the first our rulers have embarked on putting our wealth to use by constructing great works of architecture.

 srv_merchants_of_baku:1 "Merchants of Baku"
 srv_merchants_of_baku_desc:1 "Cosmopolitan Baku, at the shores of the Caspian Sea, has always drawn merchants from afar. As is common in the Caucasus and Eran many of these merchants are Armenian but there is also a large group of Indians who come, to trade, and to visit the fire temple at Ateshgah, where seven fires burn out of the ground without end. In order to make these foreign merchants settle in our lands, we should encourage them to patronize and extend this temple and its petroleum wells."

We should proudly preserve this tradition of service in our ranks as we make good use of the experience earned in the war of foreign powers."
 sis_saffarid_legacy:1 "Sakastani Resilience"
 sis_saffarid_legacy_desc:1 "Through our continued survival in the rough political climate of Persia, we demonstrated the strength that the people of Sakastan can possess. We should strive to emulate our Saffarid ancestors and remember that what looks like a distant province is actually the seeds of empire."
 sis_subjugation_of_tribes:1 "Subjugation of the Tribes"
 sis_subjugation_of_tribes_desc:1 "We control the forts and cities of Sakastan but in the mountains, hills and deserts that surround our state there are many tribes that lead a life almost entirely independent of our rule. We must subdue the tribes of these areas both in order to safeguard the peace in the lowlands and to extend our control over the highlands."
 sis_chronicles_of_sistan:1 "Chronicles of Sakastan"
 sis_chronicles_of_sistan_desc:1 "Through the centuries the dynasties of Sakastan have often found it wise to chronicle their own history as rulers of the province. This is a wise tradition that we should follow. Unlike them however we would do well to first compile all old histories of Sakastan so that we might create a new great work over the history of this kingdom from ancient times until today."
 sis_scholars_of_sistan:1 "Scholars of Sakastan"
 sis_scholars_of_sistan_desc:1 "Sakastan was once a center of culture, religion and scholarship. We should once again aspire to these qualities. By inviting scholars, founding schools, churches and charities we can restore the reputation of what once was, to the general benefit of our people and government."
 sis_overland_trade_routes:1 "Overland Trade Routes"
 sis_overland_trade_routes_desc:1 "We control important points on the overland routes between Pashtunistan, Khwarasan and Eran. Lands that have historically often been considered unsafe by traders, with some daring to cross them despite the dangers that they pose. We should create a network of well guarded stopping points for caravans and do our utmost to protect any traders in our realm. In this way we can encourage the transit trade to grow and attract more wealth to our realm."

 #Transoxania Ideas
 trs_threshold_of_paradise_desc:1 "While he was far from the first conqueror to come to Transoxiana, Timur made the region the center of his Empire and he brought treasures, artists, builders and artisans from the entire world to his great capital in Samarkand. We must strive to uphold this legacy, and continue to embellish this foremost jewel among cities. From the courts in Carthage to the palaces in Beijing everyone shall covet the gilded city on the Silk Road."

 all_lands_under_skanderbeg:1 "All Lands United"
 all_lands_under_skanderbeg_desc:1 "If we're to see any success in the world stage and evolve as a nation, we must assure that all Arberian tribes must work together against any and all foes. Unity before feuds."
 land_of_ambushers:1 "Land of Ambushers"
 land_of_ambushers_desc:1 "Such is the geography of Arberia, filled with fertile lowlands and hills, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocky terrain. For centuries the Arberian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. But this must change; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. Unfriendly armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs."
 albanian_tolerance:1 "Arberian Tolerance"
 albanian_tolerance_desc:1 "Due to Turbulence in the region, the lands, and peoples of Arberia have found themselves ruled by many different overlords. Because of these many overlords, the Arberians have grown to become very accepting and tolerant of Foreigners. Arberia is one of the very few places where different followers of Christianity, both Orthodox, and Catholic, manage to live side by side in complete peace."
 kingdom_of_albania:1 "Kingdom of Arberia"
 kingdom_of_albania_desc:1 "For ages our lands have been divided and ruled by the foreigners. Our people never had the desire or opportunity to create their own state, ruled by Arberians. But the tide of history is changing. As the mighty empires around us fall, and their influence over us dwindles we have the opportunity to throw off the chains that bind us down and forge our own destiny."
 hit_and_run:1 "Hit and Run"
 hit_and_run_desc:1 "Arberia is not a particularly large or powerful country. That doesn't mean that we won't fight when foreign invaders come to steal our lands. We have centuries of experience fighting off invaders and a fantastic understanding of how to best use our lands terrain to our advantage when fighting off these invaders. We don't follow traditional military tactics and march our men into valleys to have them face the enemy head-on we take to the hills, confuse the enemy, use our infantry to lure them, while our hidden cavalry flanks their exposed rear. Before they realize what had hit them, we vanish into thin air, waiting for the next time they march into our home."
 land_of_eagles:1 "Land of the Eagles"
 land_of_eagles_desc:1 "The day when the Kastrioti first raised our flag, emblazoned with the double-headed eagle, the myth, and our nation, was born. The Black Eagle still flies, and will continue to do so as long as Arberia exists."
 break_the_princes:1 "Break The Power Of Princes"
 break_the_princes_desc:1 "Our Land was divided and ruled by local princes, who were preoccupied with their own advancement. If we want to create a modern state, we must rid ourselves of these princes and impose a single central will and rule to help guide our people towards a brighter future."

 #Bosnian Ideas
 empower_bosnian_nobility:1 "Empower Bosnian Nobility"
 empower_bosnian_nobility_desc:1 "History of medieval Bosnia has been one of everlasting balance between its rulers and their nobles. Pressured from the outside by both Rome and Bulgaria eager to conquer Bosnian lands, in the past rulers of Bosnia have had to proclaim themselves nominally both Catholic and Orthodox, in order to prevent crusades against their domains. But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church. This meant that ruling Bosnia was a perpetual game of balance, one that only masters of this game could play and live to tell. In this game of thrones, you either win or you die."

 #Bulgar Ideas
 bul_idea_1:1 "Empower the Tsar"
 bul_idea_1_desc:1 "As was the norm for Slavic people in Eastern Europe, the institution of Boyar aristocracy was common among Bulgarians in virtually all iterations of their state. However, over the centuries, these Boyars have grown far too powerful and corrupt. We must curtail the power of the aristocracy and empower the Tsar once more."
 bul_idea_2:1 "Reformed Coinage"
 bul_idea_2_desc:1 "To pay for our new professional army, we will need a steady stream of revenue. Reforming the coinage to standardize the weights will make this much easier because we know how much people will have to pay."
 bul_idea_3:1 "Curtail the Freedom of the Peasantry"
 bul_idea_3_desc:1 "The Tsardom of Bulgaria has not been blessed with natural frontiers on which she can base her defense. The wild plain that first brought our ancestors here was perfect for launching raids into the West, not for defense. If the Tsardom is to be defended we will need more resources. If we agree to allow our boyars to tie the peasantry more closely to the land, they will ensure they work harder."
 bul_idea_4:1 "Reform The Bulgarian Army"
 bul_idea_4_desc:1 "The Medieval age has passed, and we now find ourselves in a brave new world dominated by gunpowder, light cavalry raiders from the east, and siege engines that can render even the tallest walls into piles of rubble. We must adapt to these changes and make sure our armies are competent and numerous enough to face all challenges, no matter where they come from."
 bul_idea_5:1 "Reform The Bulgarian Church"
 bul_idea_5_desc:1 "The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the first Orthodox Slavic autocephalous Church. Once the source of great pride and power, it has degraded over the centuries from the countless nomadic raids and many devastating wars with the Germanic Kingdoms. However, with our recent victories over our neighboring kingdoms, the Bulgarian Tsardom has been on the path of recovery. With ample supplies from the Tsar, the Bulgarian Church shall become the chief pillar of their society once again. As it once was, so shall it be again."
 bul_idea_6:1 "Military Flexibility"
 bul_idea_6_desc:1 "Bridging the Steppe world, the Hellenistic world, and Western Europe; Bulgaria faces military challenges like few other countries in Europe. Not only does it have to remain competitive against numerous would-be conquerors, but it also has to retain its expertise in fighting in virtually every terrain type - from steppes to plains and lowlands to forests, hills and mountains. Our ancestors never feared these challenges, they rose to face their enemies with legendary success and grace. We shall embrace their legacy and destroy all those who oppose Bulgaria."
 bul_idea_7:1 "Lessons from Rome"
 bul_idea_7_desc:1 "The golden age of the Roman Empire is over. Just as the once mighty empire has fallen, its pretenders seem to be moving in the same direction. We must learn from their mistakes and build upon our strategic position at the heart of one of the continent's most important trade routes, as well as our dynastic connections to the royal houses of Europe. Let other kingdoms fear the reemergence of the Bulgarian Tsardom once more, risen from ashes like a phoenix."

 slo_universitas_istropolitana:1 "Universitas Pressburgensis"
 slo_universitas_istropolitana_desc:1 "The Pannonian region is sorely lacking in institutions of higher learning. Let us create a great Danubian university, as a sign of our newfound confidence and to avoid relying on foreign scholars, jurists and bureaucrats. Learned men will flock to our borders, not to serve us but to train a new generation of administrators for our great country."
 slo_literary_language:1 "Nitravian Literary Language"
 slo_literary_language_desc:1 "In their eagerness to spread the word of reformation in our lands, Protestants have begun to translate the catechism, the Bible, hymns, and various pamphlets into the Nitravian language. Eager to fight back, Catholic communities have also started to propagate a Nitravian written language of their own. While this religious schism looks like it will split our society for some time, their determination will ensure that the Nitravian language will soon be as literary as any other Slavic tongue. We must do what we can to strengthen this development for the benefit of the Nitravian people."
 slo_slovak_national_awakening:1 "Nitravian National Awakening"
 slo_slovak_national_awakening_desc:1 "The Spirit of Enlightenment is sweeping across Europe. Eager to spread the light of knowledge to the Nitravian people some of our greater minds are founding academies and attempting to codify the Nitravian language. Having long been resigned to serve foreign masters the Nitravian people is now awakening to take their place as the foremost among the Slavs of Central Europe. The time has come for a new Greater Nitravian Empire!"

 DAL_kingdom_of_dalmatia_desc:1 "When the Byzantines failed to protect the Principalities, the cities of Dalmatia agreed that we must seek the protection of either the Venetians or the Bulgars. Under Venice, we maintained our royal titles. The independent principalities were governed by our own people, but the Kingdom of Dalmatia existed under union with the Republic of Venice. Whether under a King of our own, or a foreigner, the stability granted by our dual-government system shall keep the people pacified and productive."

 #Herzegovina Ideas
 HRZ_saint_sava:1 "Saint Sava"
 HRZ_saint_sava_desc:1 "The official title of our nation is the Duchy of Saint Sava. We adopted this title to distance ourselves from the Bogomilist Kingdom of Bosnia, and to venerate the great Saint Sava who had been a unifying icon for many of the different peoples of the Balkans. Saint Sava was a count of Hum who abandoned his royal titles to become a monk on Mount Athos, which he would then transform into an important religious center for the Orthodox church with the establishment of the Monastery of Hilandar. Saint Sava represents to us our dedication to the Orthodox church and is the icon that separates us from the Bosnian Kingdom."
 HRZ_ottoman_accommodation:1 "Accommodation with the Cuman Turks"
 HRZ_ottoman_accommodation_desc:1 "While many other nations resist the growing power of the Cuman Turks, many nobles in Herzegovina flock to the Turks for support in overthrowing the tyrannical regime in Bosnia. Perhaps by embracing the rise of the Cumans, we may be able to manipulate their nobility and armies into fighting for our cause and advancing our interests in the Balkans."
 HRZ_shifting_allegiances:1 "Shifting Allegiances"
 HRZ_shifting_allegiances_desc:1 "Our Herceg has bent the knee to Italians, Cumans, Bosnians, and Serbians. We understand that the winds of change and fortune favor those with a silver tongue and flexible foreign policy. We have never been a great empire or kingdom, but we have continued to protect our interests both as an independent nation and subject of foreign powers through our flexible diplomacy and fierce negotiation tactics. By keeping our ears open to new diplomatic opportunities, we shall continue to protect our interests in the inconstant landscape of Mediterranean politics."

 #Moldavian Ideas

 moldavia_metropoly_desc:1 "Moldavian Orthodoxy proved resistant to foreign influences, it survived through the Mongol invasion and rejected Transylvanian and Polish Catholic missionaries. The Metropolis of Moldavia, the autonomous Orthodox church of the realm, doesn't just work tirelessly to preserve the Orthodox faith, its churches and monasteries are also centers of learning, art and culture."

 #Ragusan Ideas
 patronage:1 "Patronage"
 patronage_desc:1 "Our maritime affairs and land trading has significant success under the patronage of Constantinople. By paying them a symbolic tribute we can maintain our independence and receive trading benefits. Historically, in 1481 Ragusa passed into Byzantine protection by paying an increased tribute of 12.500 ducats. For all other purposes, Ragusa was virtually independent."

 balkan_hajduks_desc:1 "Unlike their northern counterparts in Bulgaria, Hajduks in Serbia and neighboring Balkan lands have earned a more infamous reputation. These men lived the hard life of brigands, always in danger, always on the move: preying on poorly defended roads, ambushing Cuman tax collectors and merchants. However, during wars, these experienced, tough men often filled the ranks of Serbian armies, providing excellent - if a bit undisciplined - infantry."

 #Transylvanian Ideas

 unio_trium_nationum_desc:1 "The Magyars were once a nomadic people that traversed the wide open plains of the pontic steppe. However, with the conclusion of the 9th century, these nomadic Magyar tribes would be forced to flee west from the ensuing armies of the Pecheneg Horde.

However, since the time of Ottokar II the Imperial title was firmly in the hands of the Bohemian crown, a feat only possible with his power base in Austrian crownlands. This gives the Austrian nobility a unique position in the empire. Austria must use it's influence on the emperor to reform the Empire to make it Holy, Roman and an Empire once more."

Ever since the Ionian Islands have been ruled by Neapolitan and Venetian families, even after the Byzantine reconquest of the islands. Over time Italian customs and language has become more and more ingrained with our native ones and under foreign rule we have managed to become one of the few bridges between east and west."

The Frank and Italians who came after them have continued to construct a great number of castles and forts here and with so many greedy eyes resting on our possessions we would do well to continue that tradition. Let us build a strong system of forts and fortified ports so that we can use the environment of these beautiful yet rugged islands to our advantage.

Some families now control hundreds of small ships that regularly call the ports of Macedonia and Anatolia, Crete, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt and the many trading ports of the Italian Peninsula. We must do what we can to further encourage these entrepreneurs by abolishing hindering rules, regulations and tariffs and accommodating their trade."

 #Cypriote Ideas
 king_of_jerusalem:1 "Accidental Independence"
 king_of_jerusalem_desc:1 "In 1412, the turkic Aq Qoyunlu - called the White Sheep - took advantage of the ongoing Egyptian civil war and stormed into the Delta, taking the region in mere months, and eventually even Alexandria. Only the unlikely victory of Dauäid III in Memphis prevented the downfall of the whole nation. Nevertheless, this conflict split off our island from the rest of Egypt, and we soon found ourselves isolated from our old masters, leaving us in a state of accidental independence. Despite, everything we have never forgotten our oath of allegiance to the Pharao, and should he ever call upon us, we are ready to answer."
 frankish_crusaders:1 "Last Egyptian Bastion"
 frankish_crusaders_desc:1 "It's not a coincidence that the Aq Qoyunlu stay determent on conquering our island, despite not having anything even closely resembling a navy. They know, that our island will be critical for any Egyptian attempt on retaking the Delta. The spirit of Egyptian rule is still strong in us, and the last officially appointed governor has made an oath, that we shall seize at least some of the Egyptian coastline for our old masters. Let's prove we still have that fire in us."
 commandaria_wine:1 "Commandaria Wine"
 commandaria_wine_desc:1 "In the aftermath of the Mongol Invasion, the Byzantine emperor held a contest to determine the greatest wine in the world. Does it shock anyone that our Commandaria proved the Apostle of Wines in this greatest of competitions? Commandaria is ancient and just as tasty as it was hundreds of years ago. Even the Muslims of Arabia have developed a taste for it, despite supposedly refraining from alcohol."
 lusignan_diplomacy:1 "Island of Diplomacy"
 lusignan_diplomacy_desc:1 "During the time of Egypto-Byzantine coordination, our island became an important meeting point for diplomats, monarchs, and generals to plan their next step in shaking off the Mongol yoke. Even today, with Egypt nearly destroyed, our island is one of the few places where meetings between the formerly foremost powers of the east still can take place."
 cypriot_fortifications:1 "Cypriot Fortifications"
 cypriot_fortifications_desc:1 "Many, many powers have threatened Cyprus over the centuries, and neither the Greeks nor the Egyptians had plans to make it easy for them. Everywhere you look, this island is fortified with the finest examples of Medieval castles and fortifications, proof that we are here to stay, to the dismay of anyone, be it the Turks, the Cappadocians, or overly enthusiastic Greek nationalist."
 repel_the_corsairs:1 "The Stranded Fleet"
 repel_the_corsairs_desc:1 "After the Aq Qoyunlu managed by trickery and shameless treachery to occupy the Delta, and the rest of the Egyptian coast, nearly the whole Egyptian fleet set sail, for the last remaining free port - Cyprus. Now, despite our small size, our navy is one of the strongest in the whole Mediterranean, and we plan to put it to good use."
 raid_turkish_commerce:1 "Raid Turkish Commerce"
 raid_turkish_commerce_desc:1 "To support the whole Egyptian fleet on our own has proven to be unmanageable for our small country, but we found a way out of this predicament and stumbled upon a valuable strategy. We can utilize our critical position in the Eastern Mediterranean to launch unrestricted raiding on Aq Qoyunlu vessels and trading posts and reap the economic rewards of their stolen wealth. Pirates may be the enemies of all nations, but privateers are merely contracted businessmen, right?"

 epi_chronicle_of_the_toco_desc:1 "The Chronicles of Epirus details the history of our region, our rulers, our ties to the Empire, and our conquests of the surrounding lands. We should have it published in a simple form of Greek so all people can read and appreciate it."

 epi_serbs_and_albanians_desc:1 "While the core Epirote state has been reunified, the many Serbian and Arberian tribes who once carved out their own petty kingdoms in its territories remain. Instead of ostracizing them, we should employ these tribes to help bolster our forces."

 greek_strengthen_control_over_the_trade_routes_desc:1 "From Rome to Venice and later the Seljuk Turks and Mongols many have sought to control the trade between East and West by conquering Greece and the Greek islands of the Eastern Mediterranean. A feat non of them - with the exception of Rome - every accomplished. As an independent Greek state it is our duty and our heritage to strengthen our control over this trade rather than ever allow others to grow rich from our strategic position."
 greek_enlightenment:1 "Greek Enlightenment"
 greek_enlightenment_desc:1 "Our ancestors were great thinkers, statesmen and philosophers and their ideas remain strong foundations of stringent tought to this day.

 #Naxos Ideas
 maritime_state:1 "Maritime State"
 maritime_state_desc:1 "Since ancient time, our forefathers lived with and off the the sea and from the sea our power comes even today.

 legacy_of_crusaders:1 "Legacy Of The Antiquity"
 legacy_of_crusaders_desc:1 "Even though today many think, the Peloponnese or Macedonia were the cradle of the Greek civilization, they are all wrong.

The blood of our forefathers still runs in our veins, a legacy that both us and our mainland cousins still remember."
 archipelago_feudalism:1 "Archipelago Feudalism"
 archipelago_feudalism_desc:1 "Over the centuries many western merchants and their families came to the islands and there was a rather unique meeting of civilizations: the Byzantine pronoia system of administration met head-on with Western European concept of feudalism. Something strange and beautiful happened at that point: it all mixed and matched together, creating a unique blend of Eastern and Western traditions, a system that works perfectly for both Greeks and Latins."
 latin_roots:1 "Western Connections"
 latin_roots_desc:1 "In the rest of Greece it seems like time has come to a standstill, while Italy goes through the Renaissance with technological progress like never before, many of these new and sometimes dangerous, yet often brilliant, ideas reach us. Solely us, with our unique connections to the west, have managed to adopt these innovations."
 naxian_ambitions:1 "Naxian Ambition"
 naxian_ambitions_desc:1 "Even though the Byzantine Empire - our old overlords - still exists, it seems like it has lost all of its glory and splendor, but its proud legacy still lives on through us. Though small our bastion of roman-hellenistic culture stands firm. We are a small land but our ambitions of restoring an Empire long gone are great."

 asu_reconquista:1 "Quadruple Crown"
 asu_reconquista_desc:1 "The Asturian Kingdom is an amalgamation of four entities, each with different institutions, culture and languages, forming more a confederation of principalities rather than a single entity. While some foreigners appearently see us as a decadent byproduct of arbitrary divisions, it ultimately does well at keeping our subjects united."
 asu_camino_de_santiago:1 "Leonese School"
 asu_camino_de_santiago_desc:1 "The duchy of Leon, founded after the final disintegration of the Visigothic kingdom is mainly known for it's prestigious university.

 asu_aristocracy:1 "Vardulian Example"
 asu_aristocracy_desc:1 "The duchy of Vardulias, also founded after the ultimate demise of Visigothic kingdom, was placed in a crossroads position, leaving it vulnerable from all sides.

 asu_unify_the_provinces:1 "Tarragonese Gift"
 asu_unify_the_provinces_desc:1 "The last integration in the realm was not made by succesion games, but by steel and pain. To secure our position, a military expedition was decided against the independant duchy of Tarragona, the region was quickly subdued and integrated. But soon came an unsuspected surprise: a popular local written work, made by the Tarragonese people, named "The Consulate of the Sea" was discovered. Our nation has alway lacked the experience of a strong naval force, but know we can hope to catch up in this domain."
 asu_early_industrialism:1 "Open up the Bureau of Diplomacy"
 asu_early_industrialism_desc:1 "The lack of appropriate measures of foreign policy has alienated our position in Iberia over time, due to a mix of arrogance and just flat-out incompetence. We must ensure this never happens again."

If we were to utilize the local geography and resources to the fullest, we would ensure the safety and security of our young state."
 cat_miquelets:1 "Miquelets"
 cat_miquelets_desc:1 "In times of war, it is customary for groups of Tarragonese to take up arms. These groups, known as Miquelets, are maintained at the parish level rather than by the central or provincial governments. As they are called to duty by the sound of the village bell (Someten), they are also frequently called 'Somatenes' and, while some would regard them as mere bandits, they are always ready to defend Tarragonese lands from foreigners, from Frenchmen and Greeks to the Cartagenese who would presumptuously call themselves 'Iberian'."

Renowned as holy warriors of the cross, the Order would be invited into the lands Galacia by King Alfonso IV in order to protect defenseless pilgrims, who visit the chruch of the orders patron, from marauding bandits. Over the following decades, the Holy Order would become a critical component in the defense in the Kingdom from not just internal but external threats.

 COR_unblinded_moor_desc:1 "The Genoese bestowed upon us a flag of a blinded Mauri, to symbolize our subjugation and the usefulness of our island in repelling the Barbary pirates of North Africa. However, now that we are free, the Mauri has come to symbolize Corsica itself, and the blindfold symbolizes the tyranny of foreign subjugation. While the Mauri remains unblindfolded, Corsica remains free, and he shall serve as an icon to liberate our people, should we ever fall subject to a foreign power."

We've been subject to German Emperors, French Kings, and even the Greeks, but ultimately we find ourselves coming back to the Savoyard. Perhaps if we perform the correct political maneuvers, we may even one day be the senior partner in our perpetual union with Savoy."

 MFA_byzantine_claimants_desc:1 "There were several marriages between the Komnenoi of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Aleramicis of Montferrat, including that of the marriage of Irene di Montferrat and Andronikos II Komnenos. Irene's marriage is what brought the Italian branch of the Byzantine royal family to Montferrat and created some sense of unity between the Holy Roman and the Eastern Roman Empires. With the passing of the last legitimate heir of the Imperial branch of the Komnenoi dynasty, the Byzantine Empire has once again fallen into a bloody civil war that has brought the realm to its knees. As the last legitimate members of the main Komnenoi branch, it has become the responsibility of Montferrat to restore the order within the Eastern Roman Empire and continue to assert the dignity and prestige of our ancient bloodline!"

 #Sardinia
 SAR_judicate:1 "Sardinian Resilience"
 SAR_judicate_desc:1 "When Sardinia was subjugated by the Kingdom of Toulouse, it was the Judicate of Arborea alone that stood against the tyranny of the Toulousians. Under the wise rulership of Judge Marianus IV de Serra-Bas, and with support from the Republic of Genoa, the entirety of Sardinia was recovered and returned to its rightful self-rule under Judge Marianus. In spite of our liege's eventual betrayal by the Genoese, we must never forget the bravery demonstrated by our good king who built his kingdom on the ashes of Toulouse."
 SAR_viceroyalty:1 "The Sardinian Viceroyalty"
 SAR_viceroyalty_desc:1 "Though we spent many years holding the Toulousian Crown like Atlas holds the Globe, we did not do so without a struggle. The Judicates were always resistant to a foreign ruler, and the only way Toulouse could maintain its flimsy grasp on the island was to establish a Sardinian Viceroy to govern the Kingdom in their name. The necessity of the Viceroyalty is evidence of the Sardinian spirit, and by keeping a man of our culture eternally on the throne, we shall ensure the loyalty of our people."
 SAR_and_COR:1 "The Crown of Sardinia and Corsica"
 SAR_and_COR_desc:1 "Centuries ago, His Holiness the Pope established the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica and bestowed this holy title upon the King of Toulouse. Now, Toulousian influence over the islands is a thing of the past, and the mere existence of our nation as an independent entity makes it obvious that we are the true successors to this ancient title and all the claims, power, and prestige that comes with it."
 SAR_cathedrals:1 "Island of Cathedrals"
 SAR_cathedrals_desc:1 "In spite of being cut off from the rest of Italy by the vastness of the Mediterranean Sea, Renaissance culture not only finds its way to Sardinia, but it also thrives here. The unique flavor of Sardinian art and architecture is demonstrated nowhere greater than in our chapels and cathedrals scattered throughout our island. Sardinia is home to a unique blend of Romanesque architecture and magnificent new innovative styles that other nations cannot even attempt to replicate, and all this finery is created for the glory of God."

They know oppression, so when the reunifyed Denmark gained the Duchies of Coburg-Nassau, Mecklenburg and Bremen after the War of the Second Coalition as a freehold, they set out to treat their new subjects with dignity and respect. In fact Danish law required the govenment to make them an equal part of Denmark, under the same laws and freedoms."
