 asu_aristocracy:1 "Vardulian Example"
 asu_aristocracy_desc:1 "The duchy of Vardulias, also founded after the ultimate demise of Visigothic kingdom, was placed in a crossroads position, leaving it vulnerable from all sides.

 asu_unify_the_provinces_desc:1 "The last integration in the realm was not made by succesion games, but by steel and pain. To secure our position, a military expedition was decided against the independant duchy of Catalonia, the region was quickly subdued and integrated. But soon came an unsuspected surprise: a popular local written work, made by the catalonian people, named "The Consulate of the Sea" was discovered.

Now, after more than a century of Afsharid rule and the unification of Persia, the introduction of stricter training regimens and the instillment of a more professional attitude in our soldiers would be prudent in order to remove the last vestiges of banditry from our armed corps."
 
 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc:0 "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized extremist sects that many of the Turkoman warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of both the tribes and the extremist clergymen without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."

 land_of_ambushers_desc:1 "Such is the geography of Albania, filled with fertile lowlands and hills, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocky terrain. For centuries the Albanian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. But this must change; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. Unfriendly armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs."

 bul_idea_6:1 "Military Flexibility"
 bul_idea_6_desc:1 "Bridging the Steppe world, the Orthodox world and Western Europe; Bulgaria faces military challenges like few other countries in Europe. Not only does it have to remain competitive against numerous would-be conquerors, it has to retain its expertise in fighting in virtually every terrain type - from steppes, to plains and lowlands to forests, hills and mountains. Our ancestors never feared these challenges, they rose to face them with legendary success and grace, and so shall we once again."
 bul_idea_7:1 "Lessons from Rome"
 bul_idea_7_desc:1 "The golden age of Rome is over. Just as the once mighty empire has fallen, its Greek successors seem to move in the same direction. It is now up to Bulgaria to use our position in Europe at the heart of one of the continent's largest trade route intersections, as well as our royal ties to the Byzantine throne and claim the legacy of Rome. Let other claimants fear the new Bulgarian Tsardom, risen from ashes like a phoenix."

 caspian_safe_haven:1 "A Safe Haven"
 caspian_safe_haven_desc:1 "This region has often been a safe haven for people of different cultures and religions. Priests, warlords or merchants can all find a place here. Perhaps it is because of this that the Caspian has acquired such a heterogenous population. Living among the small states of the Tabarestani coast there’s everything from Manicheans and Zoroastrians to Christian Nestorians, Myaphisites and Orthodoxes. This is in many ways thanks to the protection of the mountains that surround us.\nThe best way to work for peace however, is to prepare for war. We must build strong fortresses to guard the passes that lead through the mountains that protect us, and keep strong garrisons at hand to protect the freedom we enjoy."

 reform_the_diwan_desc:0 "We are fortunate to be served by loyal and well educated administrators that have perfected the art of governance for generations. Sadly, however, a hereditary office is one that over time might stagnate and lack for innovation.\nBy reducing the number of inherited offices with each generation we can make sure that we reward not only loyalty, but also ability. Able administrators must rise to high positions regardless of which family they come from."

These mystics provide an outlet for most religious convictions and in this diversity our region has found a certain stability."

 tpr_adaptive_administration_desc:0 "Our kingdom lies on the border of Hindu, Tribal, and Buddhist kingdoms, and these states all have something to offer in terms of administrative strength. We must strive to adapt our practices to what is best suited for the disparate parts of our kingdom.

From then on the Church has served as a central element in Georgian culture, in the face of Byzantine as well as Mongol or Persian influence.
