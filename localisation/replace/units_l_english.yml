 #Western
 austrian_grenzerDESCR:0 "After the conquest of Croatia and Bosnia in the 18th century, Austria formed a new type of unit called Grenzer (which translated means Borderers) to defend the borders of their newly conquered lands against the Cumans. The men were recruited from the local population and were given land in return for their military service. Grenzer regiments were considered light infantry. They mostly fought in a skirmishing role but could also function as infantry of the line."
 austrian_white_coatDESCR:0 "Having its beginning on the Austrian military frontier fighting the Cuman mercenaries based cavalry. The White Coats were drilled and equipped primarily to resist cavalry charges. They were not as effective against musket equipped infantry or on the offensive, but still useful against strong cavalry based armies."
 austrian_hussarDESCR:0 "For a long time in Western Europe Cavalry was the prince of the battlefield. The heavily armored knights would deliver murderous cavalry charges. However in the East, opponents like the Cuman Turks, who came from a steppe tradition, had lighter armed cavalry which was more suitable for skirmishing. These units showed their worth at the battle of Fürstenfeld when during the Bohemian-Bulgarian war the austrian and styrian reinforcements (with the cream of Austrian nobility) were catched and shattered far behind their own lines by the Cuman and Szekler light cavalry employed by the Bulgarians. To counter this the Austrians had a number of units termed Hussars which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their estern opponents. However the units that first arrived in the west were not the light Pannonian Hussars, but the heavier Polish Winged Hussars which were a mixture of orthodox cavalry and light raiding Cavalry."
 british_hussarDESCR:0 "As Cavalry became more specialized, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the Polish Hussar that had first entered European warfare and more like the Pannonian Original. The ability of the light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, overrun their artillery positions and when they were beaten, pursue them."

 #Eastern
 slavic_stradiotiDESCR:0 "The Stratioti developed in the Albanian-Greek areas of the Balkan. With little or no armor, they were armed with sabers, lances and maces. This light cavalry was excellent for screening, reconnaissance and for raiding into disarrayed or fleeing enemies. With the byzantine civil war, many of those who fought on the loosing side, sought refuge in the west, and the Venetian Stratioti cavalry of the late 15th century is believed by some to have introduced modern light cavalry tactics to the west."
 hungarian_hussarDESCR:0 "An exuberant Pannonian light cavalry unit renowned throughout Europe for its high discipline and skill."
 polish_winged_hussarDESCR:0 "In medieval times, mounted knights had dominated the medieval battlefield but afterwards were replaced by musketeers and pikemen. In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Polish developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies."

 #Indian
 indian_footsoldierDESCR:0 "In Indian military history the infantry was often cheap to come by and easy to replace due to the large Indian population. Cavalry on the other hand was expensive and had often, at least since the arrival of the Manichean armies in the 13th century, proved to be the decisive element on Indian battlefields. Perhaps because of this the development of infantry tactics would not receive as much attention during most of the early modern era. The role of the infantry was to make up the bulk of a force and to siege the many forts of the Indian subcontinent."
 south_indian_musketeerDESCR:0 "Tamilakam and its successor states relied on the local chiefs of the communities of their empire for much of its administration. Among their tasks was the organization of local defense and the recruitment and marshaling of troops."
 mughal_musketeerDESCR:2 "With the Kartid invasion of India the subcontinent saw its first organized use of fire arms. Unlike in the west, however, the musketmen, or Toofangchis, as used by the Kartids would serve as marksmen in their armies, firing individually at specific targets both during pitched battles and sieges. The Kartid rulers took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Kartid cavalry arm the recruitment, training and organization of musketmen would be kept under his direct control. Whether their great success at Panipat was due to the use of fire arms or not the use of musketmen became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after the Kartid invasion."
 rajput_musketeer:0 "Kartid Musketeers"
 rajput_musketeerDESCR:0 "As the development of firearms progressed the equipment of Indian musketmen increased in quality. Precision and long range was given priority as the Kartids would continue to use musketeers as sharpshooters or marksmen. The Kartids would also continue the use of musketeers in the direct service of the central authority (as opposed to the cavalry arm in the hands of the Mansabdars)."
 reformed_mughal_musketeerDESCR:0 "As the Tamilakam empire fractured into a number of Nayak kingdoms following its defeat at Talicota the local Poligars remained in place as local power holders responsible for recruitment. In some of these successor states the Poligars would acquire an even more independent position than they had under Tamilakam. Along with the continued shortage of horses this led to an even bigger infantry ratio in the southern armies. Firearms also continued to become more common in the south as well as in the north during the 16th century."
 bhonsle_infantryDESCR:0 "Many tribesmen of the Kanara, Desh and Malnad regions, such as the Berads and Mavales, adopted matchlock muskets for hunting and warfare early on. Due to their familiarity with the weapons these tribesmen soon became the primary musketmen in southern India. The Maratha armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Maratha, Kartid and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area."
 indian_rifleDESCR:0 "The role that the Telingas and Berads filled in the south would eventually be filled by the Purbias in the north. British officers in the service of the East India Company and French adventurers in the service of the Kartids or other Indian rulers became increasingly common as commanders of Indian musket infantry in the north-east. As a result drilled Indian infantry regiments could soon be found in all the armies of the states in the north as well as in mercenary bands. Eventually recruitment would become even more organized and these northern Indian troops, known as Sepoys after the Kartid term for an infantryman would become closely associated with Company rule in India."
 tipu_sultan_rocketDESCR:0 "As the 18th century progressed Indian infantry came to fight more coordinated, with a higher rate of fire and be put to much better use than before. The addition of military innovations such as Mysorean rockets and the integration of Indian light cavalry allowed Indian states to be much more successful against European armies. Striking a good balance at this, Mysore in particular would, under Yohannaan Saluva and Tipu Saluva, come to propel itself from a local kingdom to a regional South Indian power."
 rajput_hill_fightersDESCR:0 "With the arrival of Manichean powers came an increased influx of good foreign cavalry mounts to India. The use of Manichean military tactics eventually became commonplace even in the armies of Hindu and Christian states such as the Tamilakam Empire. In the north-west the Rajput warriors quickly adapted to the tactics of the Indian shahdoms and a new breed of Rajput cavalry horses also soon emerged. The care and breeding of these Marwari horses would take on a highly ceremonial and revered role in the highly militant Rajput societies. In the southern Indian climate breeding cavalry mounts proved harder and south Indian rulers found themselves having to rely on the traders of the Indian Ocean to supply their cavalry."
 mughal_mansabdarDESCR:0 "Throughout the 15th century cavalry continued to be the most influential of the combat arms in India. The arrival of the Kartids in the early 16th century and the birth of the Kartid Empire came to further accentuate this trend. The Kartids made use of large contingents of cavalry archers from the steppes of Sogdia during his invasion and the Kartids who came after him would continue to rely on a large cavalry arm. As the other states in northern India tried to catch up with the Kartid military machine many of them came to rely increasingly on the use of Central Asian adventurers as cavalry officers. One of these Afghan adventurers would come to found the short-lived Suri Empire in eastern and central India."
 indian_elephantDESCR:0 "As the Kartid empire grew the need for a central organization to keep track of its many power holders became a necessity. Under Shalimoon a numerical ranking system for all nobles (Mansabdars) was implemented. Jagirs, allowances and the number of cavalry troopers a noble was obliged to field, would become dependent on this rank."
 maharathan_cavalryDESCR:0 "After the fall of the Ahmednagar shahdom the Marathas that had previously thrived in its service came to fight in the service of Bijapur and other local or regional powers eager to develop further ways to outsmart the large Kartid armies encroaching on the Deccan. With the rise of Maratha military ability came the rise of Maratha political power and these Deccani warriors would soon form states of their own, overshadowing their former Manichean employers and proving to be a threat to their Kartid nemesis. Through the use of light cavalry and infantry the Marathan armies would be able to harass and cut off much larger and less mobile Kartid forces and carve out a number of empires from the declining Kartid state."
 indian_shock_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Western Deccan, an area of hills, jungles and many forts proved quite hard to subdue for the large and heavily equipped Kartid armies. In its desperate fight to survive the Ahmednagar shahdom pioneered the use of light cavalry to harass the Kartid forces. The Maratha horsemen employed by Ahmednagar were so successful that they were soon employed by other rulers as well."
 sikh_rifleDESCR:0 "Hiring of European officers to train and lead Indian regiments changed the military landscape of India in many ways. Armies using traditional tactics, emphasizing cavalry, were often beaten by forces with drilled musket-armed infantry and mobile artillery. In order to stay ahead it would become essential to organize cavalry, infantry and artillery to fight together to a much greater degree than had previously been seen in India. Mysore under Yohannaan Saluva and Tipu Saluva was one of the states that took this lesson to heart the most and managed to prove that as long as they could be properly coordinated with the other arms light cavalry was still a very powerful tool for disrupting the operations of their opponents in India."
 bhonsle_cavalryDESCR:0 "The light Maratha cavalry increasingly proved how vulnerable the grand Kartid heavy cavalry armies were if you could cut off their supplies. During the first half of the 18th century as Maratha power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s."
