 emp_ser_hungarian_belgrade_title:1 "Cuman Legacy"
 emp_ser_hungarian_belgrade_desc:1 "Eastern Serbia has always been outside of the control of Belgrade or Montenegro. In 1404, a joint diplomatic effort of both duchies, produced a treaty with the Cumans, that guaranteed a special status for Eastern Serbia within Cuman law. Also included was a provision, that stated, should the serbian duchies ever unite, a renegotiation of the treaty would be needed. This should give the Cuman ruler influence over the newly formed Pan-Serbian nation. We are confident, that this influence and a few other concessions of ours will be worth Eastern Serbia as a whole."
 emp_ser_hungarian_belgrade_mission_tooltip:1 "If §YCumania§! owns §Y[3000.GetName] or [4176.GetName]§! and Serbia has good relations with the [CUM.GovernmentName], the §YSerbian Obligations§! event will happen."
 emp_ser_pacify_albanian_lands_title:1 "Pacify the Arberian Lands"
 emp_ser_pacify_albanian_lands_desc:1 "The receding Byzantine influence in the Balkans, left behind a number of small duchies and kingdoms, without anybody to rule them. While regions like Serbia or Croatia had a strang nobility, Arberia was just a mess of tribes, self-governing municipalities and the remnants of Byzantine administration. To end the everlasting power struggle, the factions finally invited an outsider to be their first king. If came to be, that a Serbian noble was chosen for this task. Even if the original Serbian ruling dynasty of Arberia died out in dirket line a long time ago, so can our royal house trace their line to a distant cousin. It is only right, that we reassert our old rights, and reclaim Arberia for ourselves."
 emp_ser_tame_the_magnates_title:1 "Tame the Magnates"
 emp_ser_tame_the_magnates_desc:1 "The eternal infighting of our nobility has too often cost us the opportunity, to establish a united Serbian realm. This shall not happen again. To build a stronger, stabler realm, we must find a way to weaken the nobles, and make their petty differences no longer relevant to the health of the state."
 emp_ser_retake_macedonia_title:1 "Retake Macedonia"
 emp_ser_retake_macedonia_desc:1 "Serbian communities could once be found deep in the south, and even on the shores of the Aegean Sea. With our strength growing by the day, now is the time to strike and reclaim these lands that were once ours once again!"
 emp_ser_protectors_of_christendom_title:1 "Protectors of the Orthodoxie"
 emp_ser_protectors_of_christendom_desc:1 "The Greeks have struggled to protect the true Faith in the Balkans. This solemn duty now falls on our shoulders, and we must do what we can to defend the people with the shield of our authority."
 flavor_ser.EVTNAME1:1 "Serbian Obligations"
 flavor_ser.EVTDESC1:1 "The Serbian government has approached us, requesting that we cede Eastern Serbia to them.

Naturally, they would be overjoyed if we accepted their request, and furious if we refused."
