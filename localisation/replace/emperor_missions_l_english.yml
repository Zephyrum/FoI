At any moment though, [SAV.Monarch.GetTitle] [SAV.Monarch.GetName] may wish to exert more pressure on our nation and dissolve the democratic powers afforded to Geneva.

If we allow the Grand Council to grow their influence among the Helvetic cities, the rightful rulership of [Root.GetName] in the region will begin to come into question, and the cities will likely conspire against us.

Several such agreements exist amongst the Swiss, including our neighbor: [TTL.GetName].\n\n[TTL.GetName] is a confederation of independent Cantons in mutual cooperation, and perhaps by offering to work alongside them, we may begin to unite all [Root.GetAdjective] Cantons into a single state."

Although the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ordered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] troops to fire on the masses, they were unwilling to do so as the demonstrators refused to provoke them through violence or insults. Facing the ever more desperate orders [Root.Monarch.GetName] continued to issue, demanding ever-extremer punishment of all dissenters, the army decided instead to relieve [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was summarily ushered off into exile as the Great Hindustani Republic was declared.\n\nThe Republic's new rulers promise to reorganize the state by redistributing land to the peasantry and establishing full equality under the law, abolishing the worst injustices of the past regime, and leading all the peoples of the Republic to a brighter and freer future."
