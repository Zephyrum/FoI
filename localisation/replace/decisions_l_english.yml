However, this dream would never come to pass, for Timur was betrayed by the traitorous Manichaeans who assassinated him. This betrayal has been now avenged with the subjugation of Khwarezmia and the final destruction of the Kartids. With these conquests, we can, at last, proclaim ourselves the true successor of Timur's legacy, and be the leaders of all of the Ghurkani princes."
