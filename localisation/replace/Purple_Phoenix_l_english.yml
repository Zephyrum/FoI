 purple_phoenix.2.t:1 "Cyrene reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.2.d:1 "Cyrene was for a millennia a center of Greek culture and art, until it was lost to the Egyptians. More recently, the city has been the capital of an independent duchy ruled by various Kyrenaikian families. That time is at an end, however, and for the first time in many centuries Cyrene is part of the Byzantine Empire again."
 purple_phoenix.2.a:1 "And forever more!"
 purple_phoenix.3.t:1 "Carthage reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.3.d:1 "Carthage was a key Byzantine stronghold on the North African coast before finally being lost to the rebellious Berber forces during the Tadmunite rebellions. After the city's fall, Carthage became the capital of one of the Latin crusader states. This reconquest puts our empire back into an ideal position to resecure the province of Africa once more."
 purple_phoenix.3.a:1 "And so we shall!"
 purple_phoenix.4.t:1 "Antioch reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.4.d:1 "Lost to the vile Mongol Khaganate in the latter half of the 13th century, Antioch has been known as the cradle of Christianity. While it is no longer the great metropolis it once was, it still remains an important holy city."
 purple_phoenix.4.a:1 "Glory to God!"
 purple_phoenix.5.t:1 "Jerusalem reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.5.d:1 "Jerusalem was once the most important Christian pilgrimage site within the Empire. Since then, it has changed hands countless times, most of them heretical. The restoration of Imperial rule over Jerusalem shall surely boost the morale of all true Christians."
 purple_phoenix.5.a:1 "Glory to God!"
 purple_phoenix.6.t:1 "Rome reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.6.d:1 "Although not always directly controlled by the Empire, the city of Rome was finally lost after the devasting Pentapolis crisis. In the ensuing aftermath, Pope Leo III would illegally crown Charlemagne as Emperor of the Roman Empire. Now, however, the city is back in our hands, and although it has suffered much, it is still a highly prestigious city to control."
 purple_phoenix.8.t:1 "Naples reconquered"
 purple_phoenix.8.d:1 "One of the final holdouts of the Katepanate of Italy, Naples eventually fell to the Norman invasions of southern Italy, shamefully damaging one of the most important cities of Roman Italy. But we have finally reversed that course!"
 purple_phoenix.8.a:1 "Saint Justinian's dreams are achievable!"
 purple_phoenix.9.t:1 "Ravenna reclaimed!"
 purple_phoenix.9.d:1 "When the future looked bleak for the city of Rome, the Western Imperial government moved to the fairly nearby city of Ravenna. Then a pretty mid-sized Italian city soon grew into a metropolis full of grandeur with impressive artworks and mosaics. It certainly lost its prestige, but not its beauty, and with its reconquest, soon it will have both again."
 purple_phoenix.9.a:1 "The Phoenix soars!"
 purple_phoenix.10.t:1 "Turks driven from Anatolia!"
 purple_phoenix.10.d:1 "The last remnants of the Turkish menace have been driven out of Anatolia, which was once the heartland of their power. With Anatolia secured, our prosperity is assured!"
 purple_phoenix.10.a:1 "The Phoenix rises!"

 triumph_greece_title:1 "Triumph for Egypt"
 triumph_greece_desc:1 "The soldiers and generals that have secured Egypt once again surely deserve the highest of honors!"
 triumph_asia_title:1 "Triumph for the Barbarie coast"
 triumph_asia_desc:1 "Now that the Barbarie coast is secure, the provincial capital of Carthage is once again safe from nomadic Berber raiders. The army deserves to march in triumph through the streets, and our generals must be commended."
 triumph_anatolia_title:1 "Triumph for Anatolia"
 triumph_anatolia_desc:1 "With the reconquest of Anatolia complete, we can honor the victorious soldiers and generals with a triumphal march through the capital, a tradition that dates back to the earliest days of Rome. While defunct for many years, our phoenix-like rebirth seems like an apt time to restart it."
