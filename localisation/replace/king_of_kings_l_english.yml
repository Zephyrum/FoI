 restoration_of_the_senate_reform_desc:1 "One of the oldest institutions within the Roman Empire, the Senate, called Synkletos in Greek, was once the administrative heart of the old imperial State. Despite this crucial role, the Senate has slowly devolved into becoming a mere pawn of the Emperor. However, the reemergence of the merchant guilds and academic class has resulted in a growing desire to restore the Senate's former authority. With the Senate restored, the citizens of the Empire can finally feel represented."
