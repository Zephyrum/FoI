 BYZ_economic_independence_title:0 "Economic Recovery"
 BYZ_economic_independence_desc:0 "During the age of strive, our markets collapsed, businesses closed, and piracy and smuggling ran rampant in the Aegean. Successive Emperors tried to make Byzantine markets into an invaluable asset of the foreign merchants, but our own traders undercut these efforts, by making deals with the pirates, with the crown unable to act, due to it's dependency on grain imports into Constantinople. This had the disastrous effect of destroying the foreign merchants' trust and letting them be outcompeted. After we beat back these pirates, let's reclaim those markets."


 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_title:0 "Peloponnesian Renaissance"
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_desc:0 "While Constantinople was embroiled in one civil war after the other, no man was save, and every ambition was seen as a threat by someone, as innocent as it may have been. In this world critical thinking and curiosity were dangerous - even deadly - afflictions. For this reason, a sizeable fraction of the Byzantine scholars has made Morea their home, far away from both the capital, and the traditional secondary centers of power like Thessaloniki, Athens or Smýrna, giving the peninsula a true rebirth. Originating from Peloponnese was Gemistos Plethon, a philosopher who studied the works of Plato and had deep connections to the old beliefs."

 BYZ_church_in_distress_title:0 "Church in Distress"
 BYZ_church_in_distress_desc:1 "The rightful Church is in distress. Years of pressure on our eastern borders has forced our monarch to enter into an agreement with the Eastern Churches. This has highly upset the clergy, with many priests downright defying the emperor. The faith in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty must be restored."
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_title:0 "Curb Russian Autocephaly"
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_desc:0 "Following the declaration regarding acceptance of the Eastern Churches, many bishops in other realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, instead choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the patriarch in Constantinople. Among them were the undisputed leaders of this movement in Russia. Let us coerce them to bring them back into the fold."
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_title:0 "Mend the Schism"
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_desc:0 "As a result of conflicts of doctrine between the seveal important Eastern Patriarchs and Bishops and our rightful Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, the supporters of Nestor and his ilk have severed their ties, finally causing a schism during the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Since then, we have struggled with the Eastern heresys in Egypt, Syria and beyond. Only our force may rectify that."

 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_title:0 "Reinforce Constantinople"
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_desc:0 "The mighty Theodosian Walls are in disrepair and if civil war should break out, our capital will not be sufficently protected. We need to take action, lest we see our walls crumble like brittle glass."

 BYZ_hexamilion_title:0 "Hexamilion Wall"
 BYZ_hexamilion_desc:0 "The Hexamilion wall used to protect the isthmus in ancient times. Recently, the wall has been repaired to protect against enemies from both without and within. But against the traitor, no wall may hold. We must either commit or give up on it."

 BYZ_restore_navy_title:0 "Restore Byzantine Navy"
 BYZ_restore_navy_desc:0 "The fall of importance of Dromon, supremacy of the Latin Galea, and our dependence on the Micrasiate Cibyrrhaeotean warfs has led to our fleet being essentially nought. With the shackles of dynastic sqabbbles thrown, and the Angeloi payed off, let us once again arm ourselves on the seas."

  
 desc_BYZ_origins_of_renaissance:0 "As Constantinopolitans are filled with the dread of an impending civil war, it is the Morean territories that are experiencing a rebirth. Many of local scholars would later emigrate to Italy, fueling the renaissance."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.7.d:0 "Pronoia System was a collection of policies upon which military servicemen were granted lands across the Empire to ensure their loyal service. Such policy has been applied in [Root.GetName], leading to the slow and rather unexpected conversion of the province to Greek culture."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.7.a:0 "Alright."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.t:0 "The Hexamilion Wall"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.d:0 "The six-mile wall at the isthmus of Corinth has been in continuous maintenance by our engineers for centuries. Unfortunately, due to neglect by the local authories - some even say due to open malice - the wall has fallen into disrepair and some sections have even been used as quarries by the local peasantry. Especially the Palaiologoi, a powerful local dynasty have been campaigning against any efforts of restoring this wall, but truth is that such demands are unacceptable."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.a:0 "Defy the Palaiologoi! Reconstruct the wall."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.11.b:0 "We shall focus on our capital."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.t:0 "Defensive Mentality"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.d:0 "Constantinople can be considered to be under constant siege. Though at peace, truth is that rather sooner than later, some treacherous pretender will eventually unleash their armies upon the city. If the city is to brave such an assault, we will need to have the Theodosian Walls repaired and reinforced."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.a:0 "Let us ask the Serbians for help."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.12.b:0 "Tax the citizens, we need their help."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.13.a:0 "Great news."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.t:0 "Upgrade for Theodosian Walls Complete"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.d:0 "The upgrade to mighty Theodosian Walls that protect our beloved city is finally complete. There is no force that may pierce these walls, no trebuchet, no assault weapon. Only a powerful cannon could deal damage to those, but those are rare and expensive, something the pretenders surely aren't capable of mustering."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.14.a:0 "Let the traitors come!"
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.t:0 "Byzantine Request"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.d:0 "The Byzantines have sent us a delegation, seeking to negotiate a monetary contribution to the repair of the Theodosian Walls. Dynastic struggles have lead to the imperial treasury being chronically empty. As a party invested in a stable empire, we should seriously consider such proposal, for once Constantinople falls to a dynasty not friendly to us - we are surely will be swallowed by the vile Bulgars or scheming Germans. Supporting the Romans will also result in an ally who could come to our aid, should our enemies decide to strike preemptively."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.a:0 "We will donate everything we have."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.b:0 "Send a moderate amount."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.15.e:0 "They do not deserve a coin."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.t:0 "Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Asserts Authority"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.d:0 "With the Russian Church declaring Autocephaly, it would seem the Eastern Church was about to fragment itself, forever remaining disunited across various Bishops. This couldn't have been more wrong, for we have managed to restore the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to his former authority and successfully coerced the most powerful of Orthodox Bishops to respect his will."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.16.a:0 "Respect his authority or face heavenly punishment!"
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.t:0 "Restoration of the Pentarchy"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.d:0 "The Eastern Orthodox Church has been continuously falling to decline. Forever tarnished by the Arab Invasions and Schism of 1054, it seemed like the Pentarchy was a thing of the past. Thankfully, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]'s ambition brought it back together, and the five Patriarchs may once again convene, uniting Christians into one."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.17.a:0 "The East is whole again."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.t:0 "Ecumenical Council"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.d:0 "As per the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s request, all Five of the Patriarchs have gathered in [byz_council_prov.GetName] to discuss matters relating to the faith and unity. Among the topics is a debate on the printing of the Bible, a recent discussion regarding religious doctrine, and an attempt by the Patriarch of Constantinople to centralize his power."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.a:0 "We must have strict control on the printing."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.b:0 "We must resolve the debate on religious doctrine."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.18.c:0 "Support the Patriarch of Constantinople."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.t:0 "Byzantine Merchants Regain Prominence"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.d:0 "Since the times of Civil war, and the constant unrest that came with it, the position of the Byzantine trader has been getting increasingly incomparable to the state of the foreign one. Thankfully, thanks to the policies of state, this course has been reversed, lending our merchants with increasing control over domestic and foreign markets."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.a:0 "Invest in the Ships."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.b:0 "Let us negotiate good loans."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.21.c:0 "Provide them with more freedoms!"
 
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.t:0 "Byzantine Merchants Cooperate With Pirates"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.d:0 "Frustrated by having to pay off pirates in the Aegean, many Byzantine Merchants have taken the rather shrewd tactic of employing the help of these pirates to taking down competitors. Rather than paying them off, they send word of the routes and cargo manifests of other, mostly non-Greek merchants to the pirates. This has made our markets less attractive to foreign money severely harming our finances. Many foreign traders regularly complain about the unfair treatment and lack of protection."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.a:0 "Crackdown on the practice!"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.b:0 "Pay lip service to their worries, but quietly look away."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.41.c:0 "Take out the pirate stongholds, no matter the cost."
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.t:0 "Mending the Schism"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.d:0 "Since the Nestorian Church split from the true way in 451, it seemed like there was no unity in sight and there wouldn't be for centuries to come. With Persia and Central Asia now in our grasp, we can mend the spilt with these communites at least, eventhough Nestrians living in lands further away, surely wont follow their lead. Today, the Empire stands triumphant, having restored authority in the east, and properly united the churches in the Persian lands, having swayed public opinion towards such outcome."
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.53.t:0 "Unity with the Patriarchate"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.53.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has finally given in, fully accepting the superiority of the Pope and promising to convert [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] population in a swift manner. As a guarantee of this agreement, several Catholic ministers were placed in the administration and Cardinal Isidore has been placed as the Patriarch of Constantinople."

The enriched themselves by praying on the regions hit hardest after any type of conflic, both foreign and domestic. The court was powerless to do something, as it was highly dependent on Dynatoi for financial backing. This has even lead to the loss of the vital warfs on the southern Anatolian coast in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, where a consortium of Dynatoi debt-holders, lead by a branch of the powerful Angeloi, impounded our fleet and harbours as collateral for outstanding debts. Due to the might of the Dynatoi, the court is helpless to oppose this move, and as long as we have not repaid what is due, none of the Dynatoi will loan us any more money. We have to find a way to get rid of these debts and regain control of our navy."

These vile plunderers were bad enough on their own, but some of our merchants are cooperating with then, so they may hurt their foreign competitors, rather then them. The crown was often unable or even unwilling to crack down on these dealing, too great was our dependence on grain imports, handled by our own merchants. These leeches upon commerce are hurting the treasury and trust of our foreign traders in the security of our markets."

Despite this crucial role, the Senate has slowly devolved into becoming a mere pawn of the Emperor. However, the reemergence of the merchant guilds and academic class has resulted in a growing desire to restore the Senate's former authority. With the Senate restored, the citizens of the Empire can finally feel represented."
