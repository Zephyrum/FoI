 majapahit.3.t:1 "The Fall of Majapahit"
 majapahit.3.d:1 "Majapahit is an empire in its death throes. Once the center of a vast network of vassal kingdoms and tributary states, Majapahit now has little power beyond [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The breakdown of the Chinese trade network after the Fall of the Yuan, increasing Cantonese influence, as well as the rising power of Brunei have led to the collapse of our hegemony. Worse, internal struggles over the succession threaten to tear the remnants of the empire apart from the inside."
 majapahit.3.a:1 "These are dark times."
 majapahit.5.t:1 "The Rise of Demak"
 majapahit.5.d:1 "The increasingly autonomous Christian community in Demak have found a champion in the renegade Majapahit prince [Root.demak_sultan.GetName].  [Root.demak_sultan.GetName] has not only declared the independence of the Demak Kingdom, but also seeks to seize the throne of Majapahit for himself. Bound by our many struggles, there is little that we can do while Demak gathers its strength."
 majapahit.5.a:1 "Traitors!"
 majapahit.6.t:1 "The Rise of Mataram"
 majapahit.6.d:1 "Majapahit has proven itself unable to govern even its holdings on Java. A rival state, calling itself the Kingdom of Mataram, has emerged on the southern part of the island and has laid claim to the legacy of the empire. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can do little but watch as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] empire collapses around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 majapahit.9.t:1 "An Offer of Aid"
 majapahit.9.d:1 "The situation in [Root.GetName] is dire, but it seems that all is not lost yet. A group of wealthy Christian merchants have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with an offer. They will pay us handsomely for trading privileges in our ports and the right to practice their religion freely with [Root.GetName]. The Bhattara Saptaprabhu warn that the instability of the empire may attract our people to the merchant’s foreign faith, discarding the founding traditions of the Majapahit empire. Silver, however, makes for its own counter-argument."
 majapahit.9.a:1 "Their help is most welcome."
 majapahit.9.b:1 "We do not need aid from heathens. Banish them."
 maj_muslim_traders_tt:1 "§YThe merchants will evangelize their Nestorian faith in our provinces§!"
 majapahit.10.t:1 "Spread of Christianity in [maj_sunni_province.GetName]"
 majapahit.10.d:1 "Christian communities have existed in Majapahit for centuries. Through trade, through the movement of peoples, and through proselytization these communities have grown ever larger. In these dark times, Christianity offers solace and stability to communities that can no longer rely on the state to protect them. In [maj_sunni_province.GetName] the people have widely accepted Nestorian Christendom to the detriment of traditional Hindu-Buddhism."
 majapahit.10.a:1 "They dare abandon the gods?"
 desc_maj_harmed_trade_relations:1 "We turned away the Christian merchants who wanted to trade with us. We are left economically isolated."
