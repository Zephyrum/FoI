 majapahit.3.t:1 "The Fall of Majapahit"
 majapahit.3.d:1 "Majapahit is an empire in its death throes. Once the center of a vast network of vassal kingdoms and tributary states, Majapahit now has little power beyond [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The breakdown of the Chinese trade network after the Fall of the Yuan, increasing Cantonese influence, as well as the rising power of Brunei have led to the collapse of our hegemony. Worse, internal struggles over the succession threaten to tear the remnants of the empire apart from the inside."

 majapahit.5.t:1 "The Rise of Demak"

Bound by our many struggles, there is little that we can do while Demak gathers its strength."

 majapahit.9.d:1 "The situation in [Root.GetName] is dire, but it seems that all is not lost yet. A group of wealthy Christian merchants have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with an offer. They will pay us handsomely for trading privileges in our ports and the right to practice their religion freely with [Root.GetName]. The Bhattara Saptaprabhu warn that the instability of the empire may attract our people to the merchant’s foreign faith, discarding the founding traditions of the Majapahit empire. Silver, however, makes for its own counter-argument."

In these dark times, Christianity offers solace and stability to communities that can no longer rely on the state to protect them. In [maj_sunni_province.GetName] the people have widely accepted Nestorian Christendom to the detriment of traditional Hindu-Buddhism."
