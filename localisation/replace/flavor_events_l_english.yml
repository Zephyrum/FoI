 flavor_dlh.EVTNAME1:1 "The Marathas"
 flavor_dlh.EVTDESC1:1 "Having long served the various masters of the Deccan, the Marathas have perfected the guerrilla like warfare of that plateau. The growing influence of the Marathi captains in our ranks, as well as the growth of a Maratha literary language, has inspired an increasing feeling of separatism in their ranks. Too many, it would appear that their time is now."

 flavor_dlh.EVTDESC2:1 "Your Highness, forces suspected to be led by the Timurid ruler [TIM.Monarch.GetName] have been moving into Thar and the Indus valley. If this is indeed [TIM.Monarch.GetName] and not an ordinary raid by Pashtun tribesmen we could be facing an outright invasion. I have a very bad feeling about this... Perhaps we should attempt to negotiate?"

 flavor_dlh.EVTDESC3:1 "The Bori Dynasty has seized control of our nation. The dynasty is widely disliked and, both the population of this shahdom and our neighbors are expressing their disapproval of their usurpation. The best we can do is to weather the storm that the actions of our new monarchs have caused."
 flavor_dlh.EVTOPTA3:1 "Curses!"
 flavor_dlh.EVTNAME4:1 "The Incompetence of the Boris"
 flavor_dlh.EVTDESC4:1 "The Bori Dynasty has been a disaster for our nation! Their manifest incompetence has ruined the state, brought the populace to the verge of outright revolt, and made our neighbors both despise us and to plot against us. The best we can do is to persevere despite the troubles that our useless monarchs have caused."
 flavor_dlh.5.t:1 "The Rise of [MUL.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_dlh.5.d:1 "Ever since the sack of its capital in the late 14th century, the Shahdom of Delhi has been in a constant state of decay. Within a short time, the Kingdoms of Bengal, Pala, Malwa, and even Lucknow proclaimed their independence from the Shahdom. Ever since the sack of the capital our dynasty has attempted to restore its authority over Northern India. With an uneasy allegiance formed the Bori Shahs of Multan have been our last great supporter. With influence over most of the Pashtun nobles in our kingdom, they have been able to bring order to the few lands that still remain loyal. In return, our predecessors have granted them what influence and power they could. However, with the rise of [MUL.Monarch.GetName] Bori as the head of the family, Delhi is once again at risk. Word has reached us that [MUL.Monarch.GetName] is planning to march on Delhi, to impose his will on the Shah and possibly end the Kayzahed dynasty."

 flavor_dlh.6.t:1 "The Rise of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_dlh.6.d:1 "As governor of the Multan, and as one of the last remaining supporters of the Kayzahed Shahs of Delhi, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is one of the most influential landholders in Northern India. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has also emerged as the informal leader of most of the Pashtun nobles within the shahdom and many consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] more powerful than the Shah [DLH.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\nIt is, therefore, no wonder that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has watched the incompetence of the Delhi Shahs with disgust."
 flavor_dlh.6.a:1 "Time has run out for the Kayzahed Dynasty!"
 flavor_dlh.6.b:1 "The Boris will remain loyal subjects."
 flavor_dlh.7.t:1 "The Rise of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_dlh.7.d:1 "Recognizing the ambition and ability of our leader, [Root.Monarch.GetName] the shahs of Delhi have dropped all pretensions of being our overlord. Instead, they have sent us a token of their appreciation and asked that we go forward as close friends in the hostile environment of Northern India."

 flavor_guj.1.d:1 "Our capital Karnavati has been growing rapidly ever since it was founded in early 1400s and it seems unlikely this will ebb out any time soon. The close proximity of Khambat, one of the greatest ports in India and according to some the busiest port in the world ensures a constant stream of people, goods and capital.\nSuch a rapidly growing city is, however, hard to defend effectively, especially given its position in the middle of the Gujarat plains. Some say we ought to take a more active part in the planning of the city and not only focus on how to adorn it. The system of walls and bastions suggested by our architects may seem staggering but the alternative is a capital almost without defenses."
 flavor_guj.1.a:1 "Build the walls."

In addition to its defensible position it is also ideally situated to control the trade route between the Doab and the oceanic ports in our land.\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has devised a very ambitious plan for transforming the fort of Champaner into a new grand secondary capital of our kingdom. As a symbol of our dynasty the construction would be overseen by the best architects of the Indo-Eranian world and no expense would be spared."

 flavor_guj.6.t:1 "The Manichaean and Hindu Community - Vasanta Vilasa"
 flavor_guj.6.d:1 "The well being of the merchants of Gujarat has always been close to the heart of our dynasty and we have come to not only tolerate but also in many ways encourage the Manichaean, Hindu or Parsi traders that do business in our cities.\nAs a result business has been very good for merchants of all religions in Gujarat lately. In a recently completed manuscript about the rites of spring and the god Krishna a prominent Hindu merchant of Karnavati has taken the opportunity to praise the city and its rulers.\nPerhaps this more than anything is a sign of the success of our policies."

 flavor_guj.7.t:1 "An Embassy to the Egyptian Pharao"
 flavor_guj.7.d:1 "In a dangerous world, it is sometimes good to have contacts that can protect you. With the arrival of the Lusitanians in the Indian Ocean, it seems uncertain if anyone can be safe at sea anymore. We have received repeated reports of shipping being raided by Catholic ships lately. These pirates threaten the trade that our Kingdom lives from and must be stopped.\nIt has recently come to our attention that the Egyptian Empire, distant as it may be, has remerged as a regional power and has restored its presence in the red sea. Perhaps it would be wise to contact the Pharao of Egypt to discuss a possible alliance against these Catholic pirates?"

The Raj of Gujarat sends word that he has been plagued by Lusitanian pirates and that these ships are threatening the stream of oriental goods from flowing east into our lands. Furthermore, these same Lusitanian pirates have also been preventing the faithful of India from pilgrimaging to the Holy land, a journey that starts in Gujarat for many.\nGujarat may be far away but we could surely send them something to help them in their struggle."

Through the centuries this religious minority has proved resilient and has taken an active part in the development of this dynamic region.\nRecently a Parsee priest has recorded the oral historical tradition of the Parsees, from their exodus from Persia in the 10th century up to today. The resulting Qissa-i Sanjan is surely a classical example of high-class Persian poetry but it is above all a story that will be treasured by the Parsees themselves for generations to come."

 flavor_jnp.1.d:1 "While a great tragedy to many, the Kartid invasion of Delhi in the late 14th century was one of the most important events in the history of our shahdom. It is what propelled our ancestors from mere governors of the east to Shahs in their own right. Since that day we have watched with great interest as the Delhi Shahdom has gradually been torn apart by inner struggles and claimants with outside support, using every opportunity to slowly eat away at their control over northern India.\nDelhi's situation is now worse than ever and as yet another power hungry local strongman marches on the capital an increasing stream of Delhian nobles and officials pour over our borders seeking new employment and offering to help us secure what remains of the Delhian lands."

If we are willing to expand the Hindu influence in our armies, however, the Rajput farming communities that dot the Doab and Gangetic regions would make for an ideal source of infantry. Not only are there many of second sons that would jump at the prospect of becoming soldiers, many of these communities are said to already have mastered the use of firearms better than many of our regular soldiers."

A Saint from a poor weaver's caste in Varanasi has risen to unprecedented levels of popularity. Kabir's poems are an attack against useless dogmas, the caste system and the Hindu and Manichaean clergy. For Kabir the divine is formless and over-regulated religious customs only bring us farther from it."

 flavor_jnp.4.d:1 "The site of Lucknow on the southern bank of the Gomti river has been commanded by a fort long before the arrival of Manichaeism in these lands. The Delhi shahs in their day further fortified the place using materials from many of the buildings of the defeated Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.\nWith the advent of our independent Shahdom in the late 14th century the fort was further strengthened and began to serve as a royal residence. Now that our state has grown into a power in its own right, however, it is high time that we take a new look at the state of the Lucknow Qila."

 flavor_jnp.5.t:1 "M'ebed Asemana Bezregu"
 flavor_jnp.5.d:1 "The first of the great works of the Lucknow shahdom after its independence was the imposing M'ebed Asemana Bezregu, a marriage of local and Manichaean architecture unlike anything that can be seen elsewhere in India. The impressive facade of the temple is quite unique and has attracted the attention of both high and low.\nAs our Shahdom has grown so has the fame of the M'ebed Asemana Bezregu and as we now stand ready to start more works of construction it is believed we should continue to develop this unique architectural style and make it more closely associated with our Shahdom."

 flavor_jnp.6.t:1 "The Varanasi Pilgrims"
 flavor_jnp.6.d:1 "One of the oldest cities in the world and the holiest city of Hinduism, Varanasi, lies not far from Lucknow. Every day countless Indian pilgrims traverse our lands to reach not only Varanasi but many of the other holy places of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism in the region we occupy.\nThese travelers are compelled by their religious convictions to make this journey and will attempt to reach their goal almost regardless of any hindrance we might put in their way. Our advisor has therefore suggested that we, like the Delhi shahs before us, create a specific tax on all pilgrims that would visit the holy places in our lands. In place such a tax would undoubtedly bring us a steady income, but it would not be a very popular policy among our non-Manichaean subjects."
 flavor_jnp.6.a:1 "We need the pilgrim tax."

 flavor_jnp.7.t:1 "The Sadak-e-Azam"
 flavor_jnp.7.d:1 "Through the middle of our lands, all the way from Bengal to Kabul, goes one of the oldest trade routes in the world. The Sadak-e-Azam is the commercial artery of Northern India and the means by which most goods and merchants arrive or leave our lands. Making the journey safer and quicker for the travelers of this road should be a top priority for our Shahdom and for any other power that the path crosses. It has been suggested that by enforcing the existing road and supplementing the existing stops of the route by a network of Serais of our own we might greatly ease the journey for many."

The Shahdom of Lucknow would take the matter into their own hands and want to conduct a punitive expedition against Kalpi.\nWhile we have also heard rumors of the state of affairs in Kalpi this is a decision to consider carefully, Kalpi is an old contested zone between Lucknow and Malwa and it does not seem unlikely that the Jaunpuris might have bigger plans than they let on."

 #More Byzantine stuff
 cultural_event.3.d:1 "My Lord, the empire of the Byzantines has fallen to the Heretics. The last bastion of the Roman Empire in the east, the City of Constantine, is now in the hands of the Turks. As Christendom reels from the shock, Byzantine refugees have flocked to the cities and courts of Europe, bringing with them old manuscripts of classical knowledge, tracts by Aristotle, Plato, and Galen, and a thorough knowledge of both Latin and Greek. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of culture and science."

 flavor_dan.EVTDESC3287:0 "In 1481 King Christian I died and left the throne to his son Hans. Since the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471, Sweden had only begrudgingly accepted Danish rule, and the inversion of the old system of power. In 1483 the Councils of the Scandinavian kingdoms drafted the Halmstad Recess, an attempt to provide a Scandinavian constitution which asserted the supremacy of the high nobility, but Sten Sture, the chancellor of Sweden, refused to send a delegation to Halmstad. The Swedes delayed signing the document until 1484, and then with certain provisos."

 flavor_dan.EVTDESC3300:0 "In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704, having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King. Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Byzantines. The Russians were encircled by the Byzantines on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Greece, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish lands around the Baltic. Having emerged from Byzantine internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire in the peace treaties that followed."

 flavor_dan.6.d:0 "Ever since the peace of Lund in the year 1267, Denmark has been partitioned between the crowns of Norway and Sweden, and Holstein lost to Brunschwig. The treaty of Kolding established the Dansk Fristaten, a system of self-governance, designed as much to keep Denmark in line, as it was a concession to it's people. Broken up not only into small regional duchies, but deliberately administered in different ways, to hinder unification efforts. 'Lund for the Pope, Sjælland for the merchants coffers, Jutland for the traitors and Schleswig as a nobles' toy.' is a common saying amongst the Danish peasantry, who long for the day, Denmark is once again united and free from Norwegian and Swedish oppression.\nOnly time will tell, if Denmark can be liberated and made whole again, or if it is doomed to be absorbed into the Nordic Union."

 flavor_swe.1.d:0 "Upon his ascension to the Swedish throne, Erik Lukasson was faced with a seemingly endless list of discouraging tasks. The country was in massive debt to the Hansa (which threatened to stir up rebellions in Denmark in order to force us to lift the Sound Toll for them), the nobles were untrustworthy, and the army and navy were in shambles after centuries of overextension. Worst of all, however, was the unbalanced distribution of land. The crown lands were too small to provide the vital taxes needed to support the state. The King proved up to the challenge, and with unpopular reductions and obsessive micromanagement he got the country back on its feet. In his early reign, Erik also sought to stabilize the Skåne counties and and gain Gotland with the help of the Hansa. He didn't succeed, but the claim had been staked..."

At the Parliament of Västerås in the summer of 1527 he took the first step towards Protestantism when the Church was obliged to 'lend' the state money in the form of silver chalices, bells and other valuable objects. Over the coming three decades, Sweden gradually slipped into the evangelic faith despite several uprisings."

Having also acted as captain in times of war in Dutch, English, Venetian and Byzantine naval engagements, Adeler is in possession of experience and contacts that few in his generation posses. Through his various mercantile enterprises he has acquired a considerable personal fortune, some of which he has invested in his home country, especially the estates he has begun to develop outside the Norwegian city of Skien.\nA man of Adelers caliber could surely be put to good use in the service of the state."
