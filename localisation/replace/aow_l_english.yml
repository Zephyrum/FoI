 #Ethiopian Events
 flavor_eth.11.t:1 "The fate of the Egyptian Miaphysites"
 flavor_eth.11.d:1 "Word has reached us from Egypt that the Turks are persecuting the Miaphysites in their lands. As a fellow kingdom under the Patriarchate of Alexandria it is our duty to act. The fact that the patriarch himself is Turkisch hands complicates things somewhat however, a direct attack might place the foundation of our church at risk."
 flavor_eth.11.a:1 "Send a strongly worded letter to the Turks."
 flavor_eth.11.b:1 "Avoid the risk of angering the Turks."
 flavor_eth.11.c:1 "This is cause for war!"

 flavor_eth.12.t:1 "A letter arrives from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.12.d:1 "We have received a letter from the Ethiopian Emperor today. The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our Kingdom against the Miaphysites that reside within our borders.\nThere is likely little reason for concern, however, as the patriarch of both the Egyptian and Ethiopian Miaphysites is our hostage. It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
 flavor_eth.12.a:1 "Send a sarcastic reply."
 flavor_eth.12.b:1 "Attempt to apologize and repair relations."

 flavor_eth.13.t:1 "A letter has arrived from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.13.d:1 "We have received word that the Emperor of Ethiopia feels we are mistreating the Miaphysite population in our lands. He clearly sees this as a cause for war and there is much speculation that an Ethiopian attack might be imminent."
 flavor_eth.13.a:1 "They wouldn't dare."

 flavor_eth.14.t:1 "An ambassador from the Turks"
 flavor_eth.14.d:1 "Today a Turkisch messenger arrived at our court bearing the reply of the turkisch King to our concerns about the Miaphysites in his lands.\nThe reply is far from the apology we had expected however. The Turks have chosen to show their contempt for the Ethiopian court and he ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."
 flavor_eth.14.a:1 "Imprison the Ambassador."
 flavor_eth.14.b:1 "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.14.c:1 "Let's just drop it."

 flavor_eth.15.t:1 "Turks Apologize"
 flavor_eth.15.d:1 "The Turkisch King has sent word that he is looking into the situation of Miaphysites in his lands. He assures us that he has nothing but feelings of friendship towards the Ethiopian people and the Miaphysite church."
 flavor_eth.15.a:1 "Ok."

 flavor_eth.17.t:1 "Death of a Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.d:1 "The Bishop of Ethiopia has died and the Ethiopian church has requested a successor from the Miaphysite Patriarch of Alexandria.\nWhile a successor has been chosen by the Patriarch this would be a good opportunity to show the Ethiopians who is in charge. The Emperor of Ethiopia has actively pursued a policy of opposition against our supremecy over the Nile and he still detains the ambassador we sent to chastise him last time."
 flavor_eth.17.a:1 "Prevent the appointment of a new Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.b:1 "We must not interfere in these matters"

 flavor_eth.18.t:1 "Bishop missing"
 flavor_eth.18.d:1 "It has been a long while now since the last bishop of Ethiopia died and we requested a successor from Alexandria. Could the Turks be interfering?"
 flavor_eth.18.a:1 "Ok."

 flavor_eth.20.t:1 "Independence from the Patriarchate"
 flavor_eth.20.d:1 "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Nestorian conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
 flavor_eth.20.a:1 "We cannot dishonor our Patriarch."
 flavor_eth.20.b:1 "Our Church should be free of foreign influence."

 #Wallachian ideas
 cunning_diplomacy:1 "Cunning Diplomacy"
 cunning_diplomacy_desc:1 "As a landlocked state, wedged between spheres of influence of the mighty empires of the Byzantine Greeks and the Pannonian Bulgars, Wallachia is caught between the hammer and anvil. With superior enemies on all sides, Wallachian rulers developed a knack for shifting alliances when prudent. Several secured their throne with Byzantine or Cuman support and then went on to form alliances with the Bulgars or the Holy Roman Emperor."

 legacy_of_the_impaler_desc:1 "Though hated by the Wallachian nobility, the vassalage under the Bulgars ensured peace and prosperity for many centuries. As the most prominent of the Bulgarian marches, it was often the duty of the prince of Wallachia, to drive away invaders from the south, and over time, the Wallachian ruler was basically the most senior commander of the Bulgarian army. Be it the Byzantines, the Cumans or the emperor in Prague, all enemies of the union tremble when they see the Bulgarian armies approach, led by a spearhead of elite Wallachian fighters."
 
 #Kingozi events
 zan_shirazi_islam:1 "Shirazi Christianity"
 zan_religious_orthodoxy:1 "Adopted our Religious Views"
 zan_kilwa_chronicle:1 "Kilwa Chronicle"
 desc_zan_kilwa_chronicle:1 "The Chronicle of Kilwa is a book that records the history of our dynasty from its origins before arriving in Kilwa up until the present day. It is a document that proves our legitimate right to rule the ports of the Kingozi coast without a shadow of a doubt."

 flavor_zan.1.t:1 "Shirazi Christianity and the Patricians of Kilwa"
 flavor_zan.1.d:1 "Most of the Kingozi states are to this day ruled by dynasties that claim to be descended from the first Christian migration into this region. The Christianity practiced by these 'Shirazis', as they call themselves, is, however, not the most orthodox form of the religion. Many older local ceremonies are performed daily in our court and the Shirazi lineages are considered to have magical abilities that give them the right to rule these cities.\nAs the wealth of Kilwa and the other Kingozi states grows, however, new waves of foreigners continue to arrive in great numbers. Traders from Yemen, Persia, the Tamil kingdom and other faraway lands have made our cities their home and a rising class of indigenous merchants has made these groups their partners. Many of the newcomers are abhorred by our traditions. They say we blend Miaphysite, Nestorian and Zoroastrian rites with Pagan magics. If we would adopt a more orthodox form of Miaphysitism this would certainly help our relations with the other states of the Indian Ocean, but there is a very real risk that it would undermine our own rule and hurt relations with the other Kingozi states."
 flavor_zan.1.a:1 "We must follow the ways of our ancestors."
 flavor_zan.1.b:1 "Let us purge our kingdom of pagan beliefs and ceremonies."

 flavor_zan.2.t:1 "The Kilwa Chronicle"
 flavor_zan.2.d:1 "With more and more foreign traders arriving in the Kingozi coast from orthodox Miaphysite states our old Shirazi ways have come more and more under fire. We have watched with disgust as some of the old Shirazi dynasties of the Kingozi coast have been overthrown by a rising class of indigenous traders allied with the newcomers.\nAs one of the oldest and most powerful Shirazi dynasties, however, we still stand strong. In order to suitably impress foreigners and domestic troublemakers alike it might be best if we assigned our scribes to create a chronicle over our famous lineage, so that none may doubt our Shirazi origin and the old Christian roots of our dynasty."
 flavor_zan.2.a:1 "Let us create such a Chronicle."
 flavor_zan.2.b:1 "We have more important matters to attend."

 flavor_zan.3.t:1 "Abandoning Shirazi traditions"
 flavor_zan.3.d:1 "In the process of reforming the religious establishment of our kingdom we have come to the point where we will need to make a choice in regards to which tradition we should try to emulate. Our kingdom is not only home to merchants from fellow Miaphysite nations like Axum, but also Persian Zoroastrians, Monophysite traders from Yemen as well as Indian and Turkish Nestorian traders. Apart from theological considerations the form of Christianity we will associate with is likely to shape the foreign policy of our kingdom for years to come."
 flavor_zan.3.a:1 "Our current reforms have been enough."
 flavor_zan.3.b:1 "Let us embrace Nestorianism."
 flavor_zan.3.c:1 "Let us align with the Monophysites."
 flavor_zan.3.od:1 "We should invite Miaphysite scholars to help reform our kingdom."

 flavor_zan.5.t:1 "Coup of Yâ'qob and Salômôn Eshete"
 flavor_zan.5.d:1 "When King Yôhannes ascended the throne of Kilwa in 1442 his rule was questioned by the local rulers in Zanzibar who supported his relative Yônas' bid to become king. Yônas' plot was, however, thwarted by the royal advior Salômôn and the duke Yâ'qob Eshete.\nWith the passing of Yônas himself, however, it seems Salômôn and Yâ'qob have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."
 flavor_zan.5.a:1 "Yâ'qob takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.b:1 "Salômôn Eshete takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.c:1 "$MONARCH$ is our rightful ruler!"

 flavor_zan.7.t:1 "Plotting Advisors"
 flavor_zan.7.d:1 "Holding on to the Kilwan throne has never been easy and with the great number of plots surrounding the coronation of monarchs over the last decades the post of advisors in the royal government has become one sought by ambitious men wanting the throne for themselves rather than loyal administrators eager to serve the crown.\nThe faltering popularity of the monarchy lately was apparently all that our current Advisors needed to attempt to secure the throne for himself."
 flavor_zan.7.a:1 "Ok."

 flavor_ful.1.d:1 "Agwerram preachers inspired by the charismatic Axil Fourou Idnan have begun propagating for an Tadmunite reformation in $PROVINCENAME$. Many local warriors have joined with the Agwerram and together they are now working outside of the state to create a society here following the Tadmunite law in its purest form. They are violently opposed to any pagan traditions or foreign influences."

Now the Agwerram faction in $COUNTRYNAME$ have come out in open revolt against the old aristocracy in $CAPITAL_CITY$. The promised revolution has quickly gotten the support of many of the Fulani herdsmen that are present in large parts of our state and it is clear that we will soon have a very serious revolt on our hands."

 desc_ful_fulani_wars:1 "Our policies of state in general and our actions against the followers of Awsim dan Fodio in particular have led to widespread unrest in our country.
