 #Ethiopian Events
 flavor_eth.11.t:0 "The fate of the Egyptian Miaphysites"
 flavor_eth.11.d:0 "Word has reached us from Egypt that the Turks are persecuting the Miaphysites in their lands. As a fellow kingdom under the Patriarchate of Alexandria it is our duty to act. The fact that the patriarch himself is Turkisch hands complicates things somewhat however, a direct attack might place the foundation of our church at risk."
 flavor_eth.11.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter to the Turks."
 flavor_eth.11.b:0 "Avoid the risk of angering the Turks."
 flavor_eth.11.c:0 "This is cause for war!"

 flavor_eth.12.t:0 "A letter arrives from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.12.d:0 "We have received a letter from the Ethiopian Emperor today. The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our Kingdom against the Miaphysites that reside within our borders.\nThere is likely little reason for concern, however, as the patriarch of both the Egyptian and Ethiopian Miaphysites is our hostage. It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
 flavor_eth.12.a:0 "Send a sarcastic reply."
 flavor_eth.12.b:0 "Attempt to apologize and repair relations."

 flavor_eth.13.t:0 "A letter has arrived from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.13.d:0 "We have received word that the Emperor of Ethiopia feels we are mistreating the Miaphysite population in our lands. He clearly sees this as a cause for war and there is much speculation that an Ethiopian attack might be imminent."
 flavor_eth.13.a:0 "They wouldn't dare."

 flavor_eth.14.t:0 "An ambassador from the Turks"
 flavor_eth.14.d:0 "Today a Turkisch messenger arrived at our court bearing the reply of the turkisch King to our concerns about the Miaphysites in his lands.\nThe reply is far from the apology we had expected however. The Turks have chosen to show their contempt for the Ethiopian court and he ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."
 flavor_eth.14.a:0 "Imprison the Ambassador."
 flavor_eth.14.b:0 "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.14.c:0 "Let's just drop it."

 flavor_eth.15.t:0 "Turkischs Apologize"
 flavor_eth.15.d:0 "The Turkisch King has sent word that he is looking into the situation of Miaphysites in his lands. He assures us that he has nothing but feelings of friendship towards the Ethiopian people and the Miaphysite church."
 flavor_eth.15.a:0 "Ok."

 flavor_eth.17.t:0 "Death of a Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.d:0 "The Bishop of Ethiopia has died and the Ethiopian church has requested a successor from the Miaphysite Patriarch of Alexandria.\nWhile a successor has been chosen by the Patriarch this would be a good opportunity to show the Ethiopians who is in charge. The Emperor of Ethiopia has actively pursued a policy of opposition against our supremecy over the Nile and he still detains the ambassador we sent to chastise him last time."
 flavor_eth.17.a:0 "Prevent the appointment of a new Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.b:0 "We must not interfere in these matters"

 flavor_eth.18.t:0 "Bishop missing"
 flavor_eth.18.d:0 "It has been a long while now since the last bishop of Ethiopia died and we requested a successor from Alexandria. Could the Turks be interfering?"
 flavor_eth.18.a:0 "Ok."

 flavor_eth.20.t:0 "Independence from the Patriarchate"
 flavor_eth.20.d:0 "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Nestorian conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
 flavor_eth.20.a:0 "We cannot dishonor our Patriarch."
 flavor_eth.20.b:0 "Our Church should be free of foreign influence."

 cunning_diplomacy:1 "Cunning Diplomacy"
 cunning_diplomacy_desc:1 "As a landlocked state, wedged between spheres of influence of the mighty empires of the Byzantine Greeks and the Pannonian Bulgars, Wallachia is caught between the hammer and anvil.

As the most prominent of the Bulgarian marches, it was often the duty of the prince of Wallachia, to drive away invaders from the south, and over time, the Wallachian ruler was basically the most senior commander of the Bulgarian army. Be it the Byzantines, the Cumans or the emperor in Prague, all enemies of the union tremble when they see the Bulgarian armies approach, led by a spearhead of elite Wallachian fighters."
