 jewish_flavor.1.t:1 "Pesach"
 jewish_flavor.1.d:1 "It has already been a long time since Moses liberated our people from the Pharao, but we must still remember how the Lord punished him. Following His command, we marked our lintels and doorposts with a lamb's blood, so that the Angel of Death would pass over them and not kill our firstborns. Since then, we have lived free from the shackles of the Pharao, but we must still remember it and thank the Lord for it.\nThis is what we celebrate on Pesach, one of the three Shalosh Regalim, but we must celebrate while keeping that in mind. Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating. The sacrificial lamb must be offered, and all leaven discarded and burned. With this, our people will remember."

Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating.\nShavuot also commemorates the wheat harvest after the counting of the Omer started at Passover. Thus, it represents the anticipation and desire of receiving the Torah and we must celebrate while keeping that in mind. We must focus on the study of the Torah to become a nation committed to serving the Lord. Only then will the Lord provide."

Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating.\nBy building and living in temporary dwellings during Sukkot we partake in the hardships our people had to suffer in the past, and we remember. And by partaking in all this shared suffering our people will be aware that we have more things in common than those that make us apart."

 jewish_flavor.5.t:1 "The Third Temple"
 jewish_flavor.5.d:1 "Jerusalem belongs to our people once more, and the majority of its population worships the Lord again. It is a good opportunity to fulfill the dream that millions of Jews have had since the Second Temple was destroyed during the Roman siege of Jerusalem. The new Temple will be even greater than the previous ones that preceded it. \nThere is a problem though the Temple Mount where the successive Temples have been erected is now home to the various Cathedrals and Mosques which are considered holy to the Christians, Muslims, and Manichaeans. Should we build the Temple in its original position, we would need to demolish these holy structures and enrage these religious communities. We could reuse the materials though, which would make our project much cheaper. On the other hand, should we build it in another location, rabbis will be really displeased because we chose a non sacred place and renounced to a millenary believe.\nWhat should we do?"
