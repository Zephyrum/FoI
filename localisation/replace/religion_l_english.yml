 shiite_religion_desc: "Shia Muslims hold that the legitimate successor of the prophet Muhammad as Caliph and Imam was his cousin and son-in-law Ali and all of his descendants. The death of Umar in 636 in Mesopotamia propeled Ali and his supporters at the head of the Caliphate when it was under the threat of a Persian-Byzantine counter-offensive, whose failure to destroy the Caliphate cemented the Alid rule and the affirmation of a monarchal principal in a tribal society. The subsequent Shia domination over the islamic world confined in Arabia until the late IX century leaded to the uniformity in the practise and theology of Islam dicted by the Alid Caliphs. The first and second Finta however, maked the rejection of the authority of the Alids and by extansion of the first and most important pillar of the Shiite doctrine, forcing the Alids and their followers to retreat in Yemen."

Originaly supported by the Quarysh, the tribe of the Prophet, who claimed a more conservative stance and advocated for a more traditional governance of the Caliphate along with the preservation of the Arabic tribes power and privileges. They were evicted from power with the Death of Umar in 636 and the following dominance of the Alids during wich their revendications shifted from the conservation of tribal power to an acceptation of some form of centralisation. And while they still maintained an almost monopoly of the contestation against the Alids rule in Arabia, little to no protest emerged against the religious reforms implemented by them and wouldn't be until the late IX century and the shatter or Arabian unity to see some religious particularism to appear. In game, sunnism is the dominant islamic denomination in the Quraych area of influence, mainly the Hedjazi region."

All permeating the local society to different degrees despite the effort of the Alids to wipe out those foreign influences and shield the rest of Arabia from them. The region quickly became a matrix of esoteric and mystical movements promoted by the merchantile aristocraty. When the Fitnas stroke the Caliphate down during which the majority of the pre-Munharaf sided with the Kharijites with whom they shared some stances like the failibility of the Caliph and broke away from the Alids. They however also drifted apart from the Kharijite in the following centuries as external influences began to took an even large importance without the Alids' control."
