 ###MISSIONS FOR SWEDEN###
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_title:1 "Friends and Enemies"
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_desc:1 "In these changing times, the position of Sweden is not yet determined. There are conflicts brewing all over Europe, and we have to make sure, our nation is ready for the comming storm. The Nordic Union will ensure security in Scandinavia at least, even though the Norwegians may seek to dominate our union in time, and in the South and North we are defended by water and ice. This leaves the East as our greatest weakness. If a threat for our nation shall arise, it will be there. Nations like Novgorod, or the burgeoning Muscovy are greedily eyeing Karelia and Finland, for they deem us weak, while the Poles and German Orders view our Baltic ambitions as encroachment on their sphere. We will show them, Sweden will be a dominant power of this age!"
 swe_military_advisor_title:1 "Military Advice"
 swe_military_advisor_desc:1 "For the last three centuries at least, the North has always lagged behind the rest of the continent in military advancements. Too few true wars, and too much inner struggles have made us complacent and weak. If we want to become a major player in European affairs, we have to make sure, our army catches up to our rivals. We shall do better and enlist military advice for the moment our nation will be put to the test."
 swe_conquer_scania_title:1 "Swedish Skåneland"
 swe_conquer_scania_desc:1 "Skåneland is the Danish foothold in the mainland of Scandinavia. Under the bishopric of Lund, the Scanians have over time moved further away from their Danish brothers. Skåneland has always been in their limbo state of being not Swedish nor Danish, but as it was counted to Denmark, so were their people. Over two centuries of independence, the Scanian identity has becoming more and more distinct, as it's own culture, and it may be of benefit, to promote this new identity, to fragment Danish separatism. Skåneland will accept us as their supreme masters."
 swe_swedish_allies_title:1 "[Root.GetAdjective] Allies"
 swe_swedish_allies_desc:1 "While over the centuries our alliance with Norway has protected us, our [Root.GovernmentName] have involved itself on so many fronts, that we are not secure against a serious threat, should we ever come to face a threat alone. In this case, we would be forced to submit to complete Norwegian control, if our troops are far off in Finland or Schleswig. If we want to secure our perpetual independence we need to find potential allies that could support us against becoming encircled."
 swe_declare_independence_title:1 "The Nordic Union"
 swe_declare_independence_desc:1 "The Nordic Union is the dream of a united Scandinavia under the Bjälboätten dynasty. But which nation will come to dominate this union is not yet determined. Both the Norwegian and Swedish courts wrestle over who will control Erik Lukasson, heir to both realms. It is out duty to ensure it is Sweden that will come out on top! The time for the rise of [Root.GetName] has come!"
 swe_declare_independence_ct:1 "We will get an event, which grants us permanent claims on all provinces required for the missions '§YThe German Coastline§!', '§YWindow to the east§!' and '§YVarangians' Legacy§!'."
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_title:1 "The Crown of Norway"
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_desc:1 "To truly cement our rule, we have to control most of Scandinavia, one way or the other. Norway will not bow to us, without a considerable show of force. We have to overcome whatever they throw at us, if we ever want to achieve the dream of an united Scandinavian [Root.GovernmentName] ruled by [Root.GetName]!"
 swe_fall_of_denmark_title:1 "Centralize Denmark"
 swe_fall_of_denmark_desc:1 "Ever since the Danish wars of Succession and the peace of Lund in the year 1267 Denmark has been divided between the Swedish and Norwegian crown. After decades of failed rebellion and shifting control, the treaty of Kolding established the Dansk Fristaten. This arrangement has long served us and them well, but now it is time, finally restrict their independence. Be it Jutland, Schleswig or Sjaelland, they shall bow to [Root.GetAdjective] rule once and for all. Denmark will be treated seperate from the [Root.GetAdjective] crown no longer."
 swe_gain_support_from_estates_title:1 "Support from the Estates"
 swe_gain_support_from_estates_desc:1 "While our peasants and lower class dream of a future in a strong and united Nordic Union, the higher class is more reluctant to follow reason. After all, we have long been a strong nation without Norway, they argue. Though we suspect, adding Norway into our nation will more likely threaten their purse and business interests, or influence at court. Over time, our higher calls has become lazy and overly cautious. Fortunately, the greed of the estates does not know reason either. If we grant them more privileges than we have done in the past to ensure their loyalty, then there is a chance that they support us with our aspirations for the Nordic Union."
 swe_a_new_dynasty_title:1 "Stabilize the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 swe_a_new_dynasty_desc:1 "With formalisation of the Nordic Union, our [Root.GovernmentName] is in a time of great change. We should stabilize our realm, legitimize our ruler and pay off the estates before we can expand into any direction yet."
 swe_the_polish_throne_title:1 "The Kingdom of Poland"
 swe_the_polish_throne_desc:1 "The Kingdom of Poland to our south is the target of the desire of many realms: the Teutonic Knights and Bohemians try to expand their power into Polish territory, the various Rus principalities are more than interested in annexing the West Slavic people, and the Bulgarians in the south pose a serious threat to everyone in this region.\nTo achieve true hegemony in the North we have to find a policy of how we handle Poland. On the one hand it might be worth trying to get our dynasty onto their throne, while on the other hand the Kingdom of Poland might become a strategic and reliable ally against the Rus and the Holy Roman Empire.\nAlternatively, we could conquer them the old fashion way and be one of many others who claim the valuable Polish lands for themselves."
 swe_the_scandinavian_empire_title:1 "Stormaktstiden"
 swe_the_scandinavian_empire_desc:1 "There were many attempts to form a proper Scandinavian Empire. But none of them came even close to unifying the three Kingdoms of the North. Even the last attempt, the Nordic Union, was only party successful.\nIt is up to us to unite Scandinavia into one single entity and form a proper empire which can face the likes of the Holy Roman Empire or the Russian Tsardom."
 swe_the_teutonic_order_title:1 "Land of the Prussians"
 swe_the_teutonic_order_desc:1 "All of Prussia used to be a land inhabited by the Old Prussians, a Baltic people, which had the misfortune to be the target of the Teutonic Knights. While most of the Old Prussians are history, the "New" Prussians established rich trade cities and marvelous fortifications in these lands. It would be beneficial if we take over Prussia, and annex them for the glory of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 swe_bane_of_the_hansa_title:1 "Bane of the Hansa"
 swe_bane_of_the_hansa_desc:1 "The Hansa is a major player in the Baltics. It controls the trade flow from North Germany, and has a hard grip on the trade of the Baltic Sea as a whole. Additionally, it was the cause of many wars between Scandinavia and the Holy Roman Empire and caused indirect damage to our country. It is time to remind these merchants where their place in the Baltics really is."
 swe_reforms_of_vasa_title:1 "Reforms of Lukasson"
 swe_reforms_of_vasa_desc:1 "Traditionally, our country is an elected monarchy, where the nobles choose a monarch to rule over Sweden. Even though this have traditionally always been a member of the Bjälboätten family, it puts our nation in unnecessary danger. It is time to reform the government into a centralized monarchy which is not dependent on the whims of the Nobility."
 swe_dabble_into_european_diplomacy_title:1 "European Politics"
 swe_dabble_into_european_diplomacy_desc:1 "Foreign powers have tried to manipulate the fate of Sweden for a while now. The Nordic Union, while useful as long as it lasted, is one of such examples which is still stuck in our collective mind.\nNow that we are no longer encumbered by some other nations' needs, our time has come to be the ones who influence the European stage of politics and power."
 swe_a_swedish_great_power_title:1 "Great Power of the North"
 swe_a_swedish_great_power_desc:1 "The Nordic Union was supposed to be the great European Power of the North. In reality, however, it was hindered by the complicated nature of it's arrangements, and the constant struggles with the Dansk Fristaten, who dragged us into their petty wars with the Hansa - with ultimately the defeat of the Danish League, and the humiliating peace the Hansa forces upon us.\nWe should achieve what the Nordic Union could not, and become the Northern Great Power which influences the fate of Europe in a meaningful way!"
 swe_finnish_swedish_relations_title:1 "Finno-Swedish Relations"
 swe_finnish_swedish_relations_desc:1 "Finland has been part of our [Root.GovernmentName] since the the 13th century. It was integrated into our realm, and the Finns gained their right to vote for the elected King of Sweden. Still, the relations between our people could be improved even further as the Finns are a valuable asset to our interests. We should develop the Finnish lands as a sign of good will."
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_title:1 "Crush the Upstart Rus"
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_desc:1 "The city of Moscow is the home of the Muscovite people, who eventually adopted the Rus name. Unlike Novgorod, the city of Moscow wasn't founded by our ancestors but was established by the Grand Princes of Vladimir as an outpost of their domain. Over the centuries, this merger outpost has slowly grown and become the capital of the Eastern Rus, equal in Status to Novgorod and Kiev. Over the centuries, the connection between our people and Kievan Rus has become loose at best.\nHowever, the Russians of Muscovy have proven to be a formidable threat. It is in our interest to conquer their center of power to protect Sweden from their growing sphere influence."

 ###EVENTS FOR SWEDEN###
 flavor_swe.108.t:1 "The Support of the Estates"
 flavor_swe.108.desc:1 "As it is per usual, the estates have finally been convinced to support our cause after receiving several privileges. They now make a special offer to us which will be of great value in our planned union with Norway. However, they point out that their offer is more a favor to the [Root.GetAdjective] government first and foremost, and they want to be repaid after the [Root.GetAdjective] united Nordic Crown has been established."
 flavor_swe.108.a:1 "Take the offer of the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName]."
 flavor_swe.108.b:1 "Take the offer of the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName]."
 flavor_swe.108.c:1 "Take the offer of the [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName]."
 flavor_swe.108.d:1 "We have no need for such favors, thank you very much."
 flavor_swe.108.tt:1 "The estates will make their opposition felt during the process of forming the Nordic Union"
 flavor_swe.120.t:1 "The Fate of Skåneland"
 flavor_swe.120.desc:1 "The area of Skåneland has been part of Denmark ever since the 9th century. As such, it is home to a large number of Danes - but over the last two centuries of freedom under the bishopric of Lund, many Scanians have become exactly that: Scanians. They are neither Danish or Swedish, but something in between. It might be advantageous if we promote this new culture as a way to fracture Denmark even further. This might cause a short term rebellion, but in the long term Skåneland will become undisputed territory of [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_swe.120.a:1 "Promote them the Scanian identity."
 flavor_swe.120.b:1 "With time, they will learn to accept us."
 flavor_swe.121.t:1 "Rise of the [Root.GetAdjective] Kingdom"
 flavor_swe.121.desc:1 "The last piece of parchment has been signed, and the great Nordic Union has been officially proclaimed! It was a hard path, but eventually though, we prevailed and achieved our well deserved victory; the unification of Sweden and Norway under a Swedish dominated government!\nAs the Nordic Union now rises, the rise of a new world power in Scandinavia has begun!"
 flavor_swe.121.a:1 "This is the start of a new era."

 ###MODIFIERS FOR SWEDEN###
 swe_debt_with_the_clergy:1 "Debt with the Clergy"
 desc_swe_debt_with_the_clergy:1 "The Clergy have helped us in our goal to achieve a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. Now they demand a payback for their crucial support.\n\n§YThis modifier can only be removed by repaying the debt or by disabling the Clergy estate.§!"
 swe_debt_with_the_burghers:1 "Debt with the Burghers"
 desc_swe_debt_with_the_burghers:1 "The Burghers have helped us in our goal to achieve a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. Now they demand a payback for their crucial support.\n\n§YThis modifier can only be removed by repaying the debt or by disabling the Burghers estate.§!"
 swe_debt_with_the_nobles:1 "Debt with the Nobles"
 desc_swe_debt_with_the_nobles:1 "The Nobles have helped us in our goal to achieve a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. Now they demand a payback for their crucial support.\n\n§YThis modifier can only be removed by repaying the debt or by disabling the Nobles estate.§!"

 ###DECISION FOR SWEDEN###
 swe_repay_estate_church_title:1 "Repay Debt to the [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName]"
 swe_repay_estate_church_desc:1 "The [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName] has helped us substantially in our pursuit of a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. However, their contribution was not free, and they demand payback. If we want the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to be undisputed we have to pay off our debt to them."
 swe_repay_estate_burghers_title:1 "Repay Debt to the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName]"
 swe_repay_estate_burghers_desc:1 "The [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] has helped us substantially in our pursuit of a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. However, their contribution was not free, and they demand payback. If we want the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to be undisputed we have to pay off our debt to them."
 swe_repay_estate_nobles_title:1 "Repay Debt to the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName]"
 swe_repay_estate_nobles_desc:1 "The [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] has helped us substantially in our pursuit of a smooth transition into the Nordic Union. However, their contribution was not free, and they demand payback. If we want the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to be undisputed we have to pay off our debt to them."

 ###DANISH MISSIONS###
 dan_retake_gotland_title:1 "Take Gotland"
 dan_retake_gotland_desc:1 "During the 'Brotherly War' of 1388, the only real conflict between Norway and Sweden after the 'Danish Wars of Succession', the German Pirates of the Vitalian Brethren in the service of Mecklenburg, then allied to Norway, took over Gotland, ruling it as an unsinkable pirate ship. The Hansa soon saw their chance, and with a simple stroke of a pen, pirates became merchants, and Gotland ally of the Hansa. Since then Sweden was never able to retake Gotland. We will succeed, where they failed."
 dan_eliminate_the_hanse_title:1 "Humiliate Lübeck"
 dan_eliminate_the_hanse_desc:1 "In the year 1426, the Danish League established the Sound Toll which was one of the main sources of Danish income. Every non-Danish ship which traversed the Öresund had to pay the League.\nUnfortunately, the Hanseatic League had no interest in Danish prosperity, and embargoed the entire Nordic Union. Eventually, in 1426, their audacity led to an open war between the Dansk Fristaten under the Danish League, joined by the Nordic Union, against the Hansaetic League. To our humiliation, these good-for-nothing band of grocers and pirates won the war in 1435, and enforced liberation from the toll.\nWe should repay our humiliation to the Hansa by either conquering the city of Lübeck, or overtaking their grip over the Lübeck trade node."
 dan_livonian_order_title:1 "Reconquer Estonia"
 dan_livonian_order_desc:1 "The great King Valdemar II led the Danish armies to great victories in Estonia against the Pagans, however after the death of Eric V, during the 'Danish Wars of Succession', the Estonian tribes threw off Danish rule, and in the following chaos were able to assert their independence. Even though there has been Christian involvement in the region for centuries now, with the Teutonic and Livonian orders, the pagans still rule. We must follow in the footsteps of Valdemar and reconquer Estland in the name of Christ."
 dan_integrate_norway_title:1 "Annihilate Norway"
 dan_integrate_norway_desc:1 "Even though it was the petty squabbles of the Danish nobility, that brought our nation to it's knees, it was Harkon IV, king of Norway, who dealt the killing blow. Without his intervention, Denmark could have still been saved, but when he sided with Albrecht of Brunschwig, there was no hope. It is time that we revert the scales, and let them taste their own medicine. They have tried to control and divide Denmark, now a united Denmark will destroy them!"
 dan_unite_scandinavia_title:1 "Unite Scandinavia"
 dan_unite_scandinavia_desc:1 "The dream of a unified Scandinavia is as old as our kingdoms themselves. Cnut the Great managed to come the closest to unifying Scandinavia with his North Sea Empire but he was too focused on the English Crown to bother with the Swedish one.\nWe will succeed where he failed, and bring all of Scandinavia under our control. We shall succeed where the Nordic Union failed, and unite Denmark, Sweden and Norway under one crown - the supreme kingdom of the North, envisioned by so many, shall become reality!"
 dan_integrate_sweden_title:1 "Crush Sweden"
 dan_integrate_sweden_desc:1 "Oh how the mighty can fall. We know this only too well. If someone had asked mere decades ago, who shall lead the Scandinavian nations, most would have answered: Sweden. Now they have lost their Danish possessions, their precious union, and soon, if our wish comes true, their reason to exist. We will prove, that all Sweden supposedly excells at, we can do bigger, faster and better. Sweden shall fall, and the last remnants of the Nordic Union with it."
 dan_handle_own_nobility_title:1 "Revoke the Privileges"
 dan_handle_own_nobility_desc:1 "During the time of the Dansk Fristaten, it was the deliberate strategy of Norway and Sweden to empower the [Root.GetAdjective] nobles, to keep them contempt and in line. They have grown comfortable with their rights and privileges, their little power games and squabbles, and do not wish a unification of Scandinavia. Instead their interests are shortsighted and at the cost of our own resources. We should revoke their privileges and seize their land for ourselves."

 #new FoI missions for Denmark
 is_supporting_independence_of_tt:1 "Supporting the Independence of §Y[Root.GetName]§!"
 dan_prepare_for_independence_title:1 "Prepare for Independence"
 dan_prepare_for_independence_desc:1 "Whispers in the underground, silent smugglers in the night, hastely exchanged messages in allyways. That is all that is left of the Danish effort for independence. We have to harden our hearts, find allies, that will support us, and prepare for the day we can shake off our shackles."
 dan_gain_independence_title:1 "Gain Independence"
 dan_gain_independence_desc:1 "In the year of 1261, Queen-Regent Margaret Sambiria of Denmark died at the battle of Lohheide, leaving her son Eric V without a regent, and plunging Denmark into chaos. Now a united Denmark is only a distant dream. But we have found allies that will help us when the time comes. But we have to act now. Should the Act of the Nordic Union, the soon to be finalisation of the Union of Sweden and Norway, pass, Denmark will truly be no more. The clock is ticking, and this might be our last real chance to restore Danish independence!"
 dan_unite_denmark_title:1 "Unite Denmark"
 dan_unite_denmark_desc:1 "Since the 'Peace of Flensburg' broke it into four distinct entities, Denmark was a kingdom in name only. But the Danish truly gave up on the dream of a reunited Denmark, so rebellion followed rebellion, until, after decades of failed rebellion and shifting control, the 'Treaty of Kolding' of 1316 established the Dansk Fristaten. This arrangement gave back limited power to the Danish states, but separated them in political Systems, playing the Danish against each other. We have to unite the Fristaten, and reestabilish a united Denmark, if we want to prevail in this world."
 dan_monarchy_emperor_title:1 "The Emperor's Treasury"
 dan_monarchy_emperor_desc:1 "The Nordic Union is powerful and possess naval, military and economical power beyond what we can muster in [Root.GetName].\nFortunately for us, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire has his own agenda against the Nordic Union and would like to see Denmark as part of the Empire, if we can secure our independence. We should make a deal with the Emperor for subsidies in our war efforts."
 dan_unite_denmark_nor_tt:1 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a core on all core provinces of §Y[NOR.GetName]§!"
 dan_unite_denmark_swe_tt:1 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a core on all core provinces of §Y[SWE.GetName]§!"

 ###DANISH EVENTS###
 flavor_dan.101.t:1 "The Fate of the Hanseatic Council"
 flavor_dan.101.desc:1 "Since the time of the 'Brotherly War', the Hansa has ruled on Gotland, and harassed Danish trade in the the Baltic. The Hansaetic council has been a clever opponent, and maybe they can become an asset yet. If they can be convinced, that it is the Danish League and not the Hansa, that in fact will be the major trading block from now on, we are sure, they will see reason and Visby will join the League instead. The question is: can we really trust anything they say?"
 flavor_dan.101.a:1 "They are untrustworthy. Banish them from Gotland."
 flavor_dan.101.b:1 "Let them rule over Gotland. They will be a valuable member of the League."
 flavor_dan.105.t:1 "The Unification of Scandinavia"
 flavor_dan.105.desc:1 "For centuries Scandinavia was split in the three Kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. There have always been attempts to unify these kingdoms in several personal unions in the past, the Nordic Union being the latest one of them.\nBut this blatant attempt to keep Denmark out of this Unification has finally run it's logical course, and it is Denmark after all that triumphs, and finally brings an end to the division of the North! Sweden and Norway have been integrated into the primary Crown of [Root.GetName], and the whole Scandinavian region is now going through a new Golden Era under [Root.GetAdjective] rulership!"
 flavor_dan.105.a:1 "King Valdemar would be so proud now."
 flavor_dan.109.t:1 "The State of the Dansk Fristaten"
 flavor_dan.109.desc:1 "In the year of 1261, Queen-Regent Margaret Sambiria of Denmark died at the battle of Lohheide, leaving her son Eric V without a regent, and plunging Denmark into chaos. This power vacuum left the field wide open for characters like Jakob Erlandsen, archbishop of Lund, Erik of Schleswig, his mother Mechthild of Holstein, Albrecht of Brunschwig and Hakon IV of Norway to insert themselves into Danish politics, ending in the eventual destruction and dissolution of Denmark as a whole.\nAlready broken into four regions by the 'Peace of Flensburg' and a united kingdom only in name, Denmark officially ended with the death of Eric V in 1266 and the 'Peace of Lund' one year later. Harkon IV claimed Jutland and Sjaelland for Norway, Albrecht secured Holstein for Brunschwig and soon Lund and Schleswig fell under Swedish control as well. Denmark was no more.\n\nBut the Danish truly gave up on the dream of a reunited Denmark, so rebellion followed rebellion, until, after decades of failed rebellion and shifting control, the 'Treaty of Kolding' of 1316 established the Dansk Fristaten. This arrangement gave back limited power to the Danish states, but separated them in political Systems, playing the Danish against each other. 'Lund for the Pope, Sjælland for the merchants coffers, Jutland for the traitors and Schleswig as a nobles' toy.' is a common saying amongst the Danish peasantry, who long for the day, Denmark is once again united and free from Norwegian and Swedish oppression.\nHowever, the Act of the Nordic Union, the soon to be finalisation of the Union of Sweden and Norway, will likely ensure, that Denmark will truly be no more. The clock is ticking, and this might be our last real chance to restore Danish independence!"
 flavor_dan.109.a:1 "Difficult times are ahead..."

 nor_restore_norwegian_nobility_title:1 "Expel Danish Nobility"
 nor_restore_norwegian_nobility_desc:1 "The Black Death was a tragedy for all of Europe, and our realm was not spared by its gruesome hand. In 1349 the plague killed a third of our population and completely decimated the Norwegian nobility. This power vacuum attracted Danish nobles from Jutland, who replaced over time the ruling class of Norway.\nOur fate is too closely for comfort linked to Danish interests as long our own nobility is a stranger to our country.

 flavor_nor.42.desc:1 "The Nordic Union is supposed to represent the will of Norway and Sweden, and should protect their interests. In reality, however, the Nordic Union only served as an expanded source for wealth and manpower for the Swedes.

He brings a message from his [From.Monarch.GetTitle].\n"The good [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [From.GetName] makes you, oh noble [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of the Livonian Order, and your brothers an Offer of Vassalization. The Teutonic Order will ensure your protection in exchange for your military service."\nWhile this offer might insulting, it is true that our order does not have the fighting power of the Teutonic Order. And with Novgorod, Lithuania and Sweden-Norway as rivalling neighbours a strong protector might be desirable."
 flavor_teu.19.t:1 "Teutonic Claims of the Burzenland"
 flavor_teu.19.desc:1 "In it's early years, after we were pushed out of North Africa, the Order tried to establish themselves within the Bulgarian empire, to support the push for independence in Catholic Dacia. We managed to carve out a de-facto independent realm, the Burzenland, in eastern Transylvania, which was already in an disputed state due to the constant Cuman incursions into southern Bulgaria.\nFor fourteen years, the Order enjoyed relative autonomy and began to change their North African inspired tactics to fit with eastern Europe's climate, we were betrayed by the Saxon merchant-nobility, who did not wanted to risk their role as tax collectors for the Bulgarians. So we were expelled us from our rightful lands.\n\nAfter over 150 years, the Burzenland is once again under Teutonic control. During our absence, the once wooden fortification of Dietrichstein has been torn down. In its place is now the Bran Castle instead, which architecture caught the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. The question has risen of if we should use the resources of Carpathia to expand the Bran Castle and make it into our new capital, or if we should remain in [1841.GetName] and use them for the Marienburg."
 flavor_teu.21.t:1 "Reclamation der alten Heimat"
 flavor_teu.21.desc:1 "The Teutonic Order was formed after the capture of Port de Dieu during the First Crusade. But our victory was of short term as we were expelled from the North Afric by the cursed Occitan Templars, envious of our success, and we had to establish our state in Europe.\n\nThese past setbacks are of little matter to us now as we have reclaimed our North African holdings and the city of Port de Dieu, and those Templar traitors have been vanquished!"
 flavor_teu.21.a:1 "This will make us the foremost Holy Order in the World!"
 flavor_teu.24.t:1 "The Hansa and the Order"
 flavor_teu.24.desc:1 "During the great siege of Port de Dieu during the First Crusade, the Teutonic Order was formed by German merchants from Lübeck and Bremen. Ever since, our Order has grown in numbers while living by the virtues and values of poverty, chastity and obedience. Due to the nature of our core values, the Teutonic Order ran short on available Ducats.\nFortunately for us, the Hansa still remembers our origins and has provided us in the past with ships and monetary support for our conquest of Prussia. In return, we had to provide protection for the merchants of the Hansa, though this eventually turned into an error for our state as said merchants refused to help us against the Poles, for empty promises of a free Danzig.\n\nStill, the Hansa is a valuable asset to our treasury. It might be worth to renew our relations with the [HSA.Monarch.GetTitle] of [HSA.GetName] so we can keep enjoying their financial support."
 flavor_teu.24.a:1 "We should renew these relations indeed."
 flavor_teu.24.b:1 "Our relationship with the Hansa ended, when they betrayed our trust."
 flavor_teu.37.t:1 "The Fate of [295.GetName]"
 flavor_teu.37.desc:1 "Due to the constant decline of the petty Byzantine Empire, the city of [295.GetName] has become somewhat of a religious centre of the Orthodox faith. Some of our knights yearn for the looting of the city as it is after all a bastion of heresy. However, doing so might result only in a vast revolt of the Muscovite Russians against us.\nAnother suggestion was to repurpose the churches instead and convert the people to Catholicism while the Orthodox Patriarchs are getting dispossessed. This will result into a religious revolt, though a smaller one than a sacking.\nFinally, one last suggestion from our knights is to integrate the Muscovite Russians into our state, and help them rebuild their city. Surely, it will get us the goodwill of the Russians, but future conversion attempts in [295.GetName] or in the near area might meet harsh resistance."
 flavor_teu.41.t:1 "Crusaders of the Steppes"
 flavor_teu.41.desc:1 "While other orders focus their efforts in conquering North Africa, our Order took a different path. Inspired by the brutal conqueror Genghis Khan and driven by our holy mission to convert the infidels, our state expanded more and more into the far eastern steppes. By now, a normal administration is almost impossible were it not for the most important tool in our order: the horse.\nWithout even noticing it, we have become what once threatened the Christendom: a horde, stretching from the cold waters of the Baltics all the way to the hot deserts of Central Asia. However, our expansion direction is clear - we go further east as the Lord wishes it from us!"
 flavor_teu.42.t:1 "The Situation of the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_teu.42.desc:1 "The Teutonic Order, an order of noble German knights, was established on the Baltic coast in order to Christianise the local tribes. Although we had a lot of success in their early period, this mission was brought to a hold, when a coalitions of Old Prussian, Latvian and Estonian pagans together with the traitorous Poles and Lithuanians, crushed the Order and it's Livonian allies. In the last 40 years our Order has fought four wars against Poland and its allies. As a result of the recent setbacks resulting from these wars, the southern half of the country is again in pagan hands, while the Polish and Lithuanian alliance continues to amass troops at our western and northeastern borders...\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. The Teutonic Order is at the crossroads of its future. If we manage to crush the pagans, and defeat the Polish threat, our Order will be in a position to choose a new path."

The remnants were incorporated into the Teutonic Order in 1237, which then eventually led to the creation of the Livonian Order. De jure, the Hochmeister of the Teutonic Order is our overlord, but de facto both our orders are more like autonomous allies than anything.\nThe wars between the Teutonic Order and Poland have shown that the Teutonic Knights are not as military competent as they used to be - as has the continued presence of the Pruthenian heathens. It is time to help our brethren in Prussia through renewing our alliance with them - or by replacing their archaic administration with our own superior reign."
 liv_handle_internal_struggle_title:1 "The Livonian Confederacy"
 liv_handle_internal_struggle_desc:1 "The Livonian Confederacy was a loosely organized confederacy under our rule which was created in 1435. It is a defensive alliance of the five bishoprics and the Livonian Order to protect the German rule over Curonia, Livonia and Estonia against the threat from Novgorod and its Orthodox Church, and the ongoing pagan threat.\nHowever, the different bishoprics within the confederacy are not our subjects but autonomous states, and as such they often have petty rivalries with each other. It is time to dissolve this confederacy, and integrate the lands of the bishoprics into our own."

We now have the opportunity to bring that flock back to the fold of the one true faith, healing the wound that has divided the Catholic Church for centuries."

 flavor_liv.0.desc:1 "The Livonian Order is the successor of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, an order of knights which was annihilated by the Samogitians in 1236. While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\nHowever, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Nordic Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, conspiring with the pagan tribes to do so, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain, and - would you believe it? -  even conspiring with the heathens, flaunting heretical nonsense like 'religious liberty'.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.3.t:1 "Purchase of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.3.desc:1 "The Livonian Confederacy is making it difficult to maintain our rule over the lands of Curonia, Livonia and Estonia, and are trying to achive some kind of 'Ausgleich' nonsense with the heathens. Fortunately, these bishops are not the saints they claim to be, and are willing to sell their land to us."

 #Events 
 flavor_hsa.8.t:1 "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d:1 "Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and the increasing threat posed by Swedish claims to the island. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."

 estate_nobles_danish_nobility_desc:1 "Due to the Black Death, only a handful of Norwegian nobles rule over our country. This power vacuum attracted nobles from Jutland, who now have considerable - some say dangerous - sway over Norwegian politics."
 estate_nobles_nobles_instead_of_royal_court_desc:1 "The Black Death killed over half of the Norwegian population, and as such, a wholely native royal court was no longer feasible to maintain. Instead, our [Root.GovernmentName] is ruled by a fragile coalition of old Norwegian and new Danish nobility from Jutland, who inherited former Norwegian titles and land. As long they have power, the legitimacy of a true Norwegian monarch will always be a topic of contention."

 embedded_norse_government_reform_desc:1 "For centuries, our devout ancestors raided the shores of the Baltic Sea, bringing fear to all those who opposed the followers of the true faith. However, these traditions were slowly forgotten as the shores of Baltia were under the heel of the Cusader yoke. With our recent victories over the Crusaders, we must restore these traditions so that we may cast the heathens from over shores and restore our mastery over the Baltic Sea once more."
