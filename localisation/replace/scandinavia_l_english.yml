 ###MISSIONS FOR TEUTONIC ORDER###
 teu_strengthen_livonia_title:0 "Bound of the Orders"
 teu_strengthen_livonia_desc:0 "Although both our states are monastic orders, the interests of the Livonian and the Teutonic Orders are rarely the same ever since the Pagan-Polish-Lithuanian alliance so shamefully defeated us. Too much blame has been layed out from both sides. As such the alliance we have with the Livonians is not one of certainty. We should strengthen our position within the Livonian Order by either improving our diplomacy with them - or by subjugating them."
 teu_pru_conquer_poland_title:0 "Conquer Red Ruthenia"
 teu_pru_conquer_poland_desc:0 "We have to push further south in order to neutralize the Polish threat once and for all! Their last remnants try to hide with their former enemies in the heretic lands of Red Ruthenia."
 teu_pru_conquer_poland_at:0 "This modifier gets removed should we ever demote the §YPolish§! culture."
 teu_pru_conquer_poland_bt:0 "This modifier gets removed should we ever demote the §YRuthenian§! culture."
 teu_pru_take_over_moldavia_title:0 "Take over Moldavia"
 teu_pru_take_over_moldavia_desc:0 "The Moldavian lands are a fertile patch of land which is known for its wine production. It is also the access point for the Cumans or Byzantines to Ruthenia. We should annex Moldavia in order to prevent our enemies from expanding into East Europe, and, of course, in order to get access to the wine."
 teu_pru_fortify_the_borders_title:0 "Fortify the Borders"
 teu_pru_fortify_the_borders_desc:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] reaches from the Baltic all the way down to the Black Sea. Due to the vastness of our territory we are bordering many potential threats such as the Holy Roman Empire to our west or the Byzantines in the south."
 teu_pru_push_into_ruthenia_title:0 "Push into Ruthenia"
 teu_pru_push_into_ruthenia_desc:0 "Ruthenia is a vast region with farms and grasslands everywhere the eye can see. Lithuania never managed to fully conquered these lands from the hordes, and now it is our turn to succeed where they failed."
 teu_pru_dominate_baltic_trade_title:0 "Protect the Baltic Trade"
 teu_pru_dominate_baltic_trade_desc:0 "The Baltic trade is the main source of our income. We should protect it from the merchants of the Hansa or the Danish Freestates, or otherwise we will lose profit."
 teu_crusader_end_the_schism_title:0 "End the Schism"
 teu_crusader_end_the_schism_desc:0 "For too long, Christendom has been divided over petty differences in faith. The Popes saw little reason to heal it, and the fools of the Byzantine Empire were too busy getting embroiled in dynastic squabbles. It is up to us to heal this schism and end this heresy."
 teu_crusader_end_the_schism_tt:0 "Every §YOrthodox§! country will receive the event '§YThe Teutonic Order ends Schism§!'."
 teu_crusader_conquer_crimea_title:0 "Christianize the Steppes"
 teu_crusader_conquer_crimea_desc:0 "The Pontic Steppes might not be inhabited by Pagans, but are still ruled by them. We must ride into the steppes and bring our crusade to the hordes!"
 teu_crusader_fortify_the_caucasus_title:0 "Fortify the Caucasus"
 teu_crusader_fortify_the_caucasus_desc:0 "The Caucasus is the natural border between Europe and Asia in the south. As this mountain range is also the border between our state and the Miaphysite and Nestorians heretics or even Zoroastrians heathens are always threatening to cross the mountains in a moment notice. We should conquer the northern part of the Caucasus and fortify it."

 ###EVENTS FOR TEUTONIC ORDER###
 flavor_teu.14.t:0 "[From.GetName] offers Vassalization"
 flavor_teu.14.desc:0 "A squire from the Teutonic Order arrived this morning at our court. He brings a message from his [From.Monarch.GetTitle].\n"The good [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [From.GetName] makes you, oh noble [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of the Livonian Order, and your brothers an Offer of Vassalization. The Teutonic Order will ensure your protection in exchange for your military service."\nWhile this offer might insulting, it is true that our order does not have the fighting power of the Teutonic Order. And with Novgorod, Lithuania and Sweden-Norway as rivalling neighbours a strong protector might be desirable."
 flavor_teu.19.t:0 "Teutonic Claims of the Burzenland"
 flavor_teu.19.desc:1 "In it's early years, after we were pushed out of North Africa, the Order tried to establish themselves within the Bulgarian empire, to support the push for independence in Catholic Dacia. We managed to carve out a de-facto independent realm, the Burzenland, in eastern Transylvania, which was already in an disputed state due to the constant Cuman incursions into southern Bulgaria.\nFor fourteen years, the Order enjoyed relative autonomy and began to change their North African inspired tactics to fit with eastern Europe's climate, we were betrayed by the Saxon merchant-nobility, who did not wanted to risk their role as tax collectors for the Bulgarians. So we were expelled us from our rightful lands.\n\nAfter over 150 years, the Burzenland is once again under Teutonic control. During our absence, the once wooden fortification of Dietrichstein has been torn down. In its place is now the Bran Castle instead, which architecture caught the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. The question has risen of if we should use the resources of Carpathia to expand the Bran Castle and make it into our new capital, or if we should remain in [1841.GetName] and use them for the Marienburg."
 flavor_teu.21.t:0 "Reclamation der alten Heimat"
 flavor_teu.21.desc:0 "The Teutonic Order was formed after the capture of Port de Dieu during the First Crusade. But our victory was of short term as we were expelled from the North Afric by the cursed Occitan Templars, envious of our success, and we had to establish our state in Europe.\n\nThese past setbacks are of little matter to us now as we have reclaimed our North African holdings and the city of Port de Dieu, and those Templar traitors have been vanquished!"
 flavor_teu.21.a:0 "This will make us the foremost Holy Order in the World!"
 flavor_teu.24.t:0 "The Hansa and the Order"
 flavor_teu.24.desc:0 "During the great siege of Port de Dieu during the First Crusade, the Teutonic Order was formed by German merchants from Lübeck and Bremen. Ever since, our Order has grown in numbers while living by the virtues and values of poverty, chastity and obedience. Due to the nature of our core values, the Teutonic Order ran short on available Ducats.\nFortunately for us, the Hansa still remembers our origins and has provided us in the past with ships and monetary support for our conquest of Prussia. In return, we had to provide protection for the merchants of the Hansa, though this eventually turned into an error for our state as said merchants refused to help us against the Poles, for empty promises of a free Danzig.\n\nStill, the Hansa is a valuable asset to our treasury. It might be worth to renew our relations with the [HSA.Monarch.GetTitle] of [HSA.GetName] so we can keep enjoying their financial support."
 flavor_teu.24.a:0 "We should renew these relations indeed."
 flavor_teu.24.b:0 "Our relationship with the Hansa ended, when they betrayed our trust."
 flavor_teu.37.t:0 "The Fate of [295.GetName]"
 flavor_teu.37.desc:0 "Due to the constant decline of the petty Byzantine Empire, the city of [295.GetName] has become somewhat of a religious centre of the Orthodox faith. Some of our knights yearn for the looting of the city as it is after all a bastion of heresy. However, doing so might result only in a vast revolt of the Muscovite Russians against us.\nAnother suggestion was to repurpose the churches instead and convert the people to Catholicism while the Orthodox Patriarchs are getting dispossessed. This will result into a religious revolt, though a smaller one than a sacking.\nFinally, one last suggestion from our knights is to integrate the Muscovite Russians into our state, and help them rebuild their city. Surely, it will get us the goodwill of the Russians, but future conversion attempts in [295.GetName] or in the near area might meet harsh resistance."
 flavor_teu.41.t:0 "Crusaders of the Steppes"
 flavor_teu.41.desc:0 "While other orders focus their efforts in conquering North Africa, our Order took a different path. Inspired by the brutal conqueror Genghis Khan and driven by our holy mission to convert the infidels, our state expanded more and more into the far eastern steppes. By now, a normal administration is almost impossible were it not for the most important tool in our order: the horse.\nWithout even noticing it, we have become what once threatened the Christendom: a horde, stretching from the cold waters of the Baltics all the way to the hot deserts of Central Asia. However, our expansion direction is clear - we go further east as the Lord wishes it from us!"
 flavor_teu.42.t:0 "The Situation of the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_teu.42.desc:1 "The Teutonic Order, an order of noble German knights, was established on the Baltic coast in order to Christianise the local tribes. Although we had a lot of success in their early period, this mission was brought to a hold, when a coalitions of Old Prussian, Latvian and Estonian pagans together with the traitorous Poles and Lithuanians, crushed the Order and it's Livonian allies. In the last 40 years our Order has fought four wars against Poland and its allies. As a result of the recent setbacks resulting from these wars, the southern half of the country is again in pagan hands, while the Polish and Lithuanian alliance continues to amass troops at our western and northeastern borders...\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. The Teutonic Order is at the crossroads of its future. If we manage to crush the pagans, and defeat the Polish threat, our Order will be in a position to choose a new path."

 ###MISSIONS FOR LIVONIAN ORDER###
 liv_handle_teutonic_order_title:0 "The Teutonic Knights"
 liv_handle_teutonic_order_desc:0 "In 1236, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword was defeated by the Samogitians and their Semigallian allies. The remnants were incorporated into the Teutonic Order in 1237, which then eventually led to the creation of the Livonian Order. De jure, the Hochmeister of the Teutonic Order is our overlord, but de facto both our orders are more like autonomous allies than anything.\nThe wars between the Teutonic Order and Poland have shown that the Teutonic Knights are not as military competent as they used to be - as has the continued presence of the Pruthenian heathens. It is time to help our brethren in Prussia through renewing our alliance with them - or by replacing their archaic administration with our own superior reign."
 liv_handle_internal_struggle_title:0 "The Livonian Confederacy"
 liv_handle_internal_struggle_desc:0 "The Livonian Confederacy was a loosely organized confederacy under our rule which was created in 1435. It is a defensive alliance of the five bishoprics and the Livonian Order to protect the German rule over Curonia, Livonia and Estonia against the threat from Novgorod and its Orthodox Church, and the ongoing pagan threat.\nHowever, the different bishoprics within the confederacy are not our subjects but autonomous states, and as such they often have petty rivalries with each other. It is time to dissolve this confederacy, and integrate the lands of the bishoprics into our own."
 liv_end_the_third_rome_title:0 "End the Third Rome"
 liv_end_the_third_rome_desc:0 "The Great Schism has divided Western and Eastern churches for centuries. The head of the Eastern Church had traditionally been the Patriarch of Constantinople, but after the constant power struggles in the Byzantine empire in the last centuries, the spiritual centre of the Slavic Orthodox communities has progressively moved to the Russian lands. We now have the opportunity to bring that flock back to the fold of the one true faith, healing the wound that has divided the Catholic Church for centuries."

 liv_heal_the_schism_desc:0 "For too long, the Christendom has been divided over petty differences in faith. The Popes saw little reason to heal it, and the fools of the Byzantine Empire were too busy getting embroiled in dynastic squabbles. It is up to us to heal this schism and end this heresy."

 ###LIVONIAN EVENTS###
 flavor_liv.0.t:0 "The Situation of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.0.desc:1 "The Livonian Order is the successor of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, an order of knights which was annihilated by the Samogitians in 1236. While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\nHowever, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Nordic Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, conspiring with the pagan tribes to do so, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain, and - would you believe it? -  even conspiring with the heathens, flaunting heretical nonsense like 'religious liberty'.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.3.t:0 "Purchase of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.3.desc:0 "The Livonian Confederacy is making it difficult to maintain our rule over the lands of Curonia, Livonia and Estonia, and are trying to achive some kind of 'Ausgleich' nonsense with the heathens. Fortunately, these bishops are not the saints they claim to be, and are willing to sell their land to us."

 hsa_peace_vordingborg_desc:0 "In 1435 the Monarchs of Sweden and Norway was forced to give away the monopoly of their markets in Denmark to German merchants from Lubeck. It would be wise to reaffirm the terms of that treaty however we see fit."

 #Events 
 flavor_hsa.8.t:0 "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d:0 "Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and the increasing threat posed by Swedish claims to the island. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."
