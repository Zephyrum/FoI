 flavor_eth.37.t:0 "Restoration of Christianity in Suakin"
 flavor_eth.37.desc:0 "Although the city submitted to the Mamluks in 1317, many still believed that the city remained a center of Christianity. This changed when more and more Muslim immigrants settled in Suakin. Over time, the last remaining Christians - our brothers and sisters in faith - vanished into the shadows. But these times are now over as Suakin is finally part of a true Christian [Root.GovernmentName] again and many hidden Copts returned to the light of the day!"
 flavor_eth.37.a:0 "Blessed be these souls!"
 flavor_eth.38.t:0 "Adulis, the Great Port of Aksum"
 flavor_eth.38.desc:1 "Walls made out of sandstone and empty, rugged streets decorate the ruins of a city, which used to be the crown jewel of an ancient Empire. For our ancestors, it would have been a saddening view. - until they see what the proud and diligent workers of [Root.GetName] created! Within an amazingly short amount of time, our constructors and builders restored the port city to its former beauty and many of our people are settling in this city!"
 flavor_eth.38.a:0 "And this time, Adulis shall live for far longer!"
 flavor_eth.39.t:0 "Surpassing of the Aksumite Borders"
 flavor_eth.39.desc:1 "Originally, the Aksumite Empire only had the Nubian region, North Ethiopian areas and the southern coast of Arabia. Borders which are no match to ours! [Root.Monarch.GetName] lead our [Root.GovernmentName] to many successful battles and to campaigns of war and now we not only have achieved the restoration but even the surpassing of an empire which fell over 400 years ago!\nWith these massive campaigns of conquest, many of our nobles plead for an official return to the name "Aksumite Empire" in order to show the world our strength of reviving an ancient realm. On the other hand, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisers recommend that we start looking into the future. How shall our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decide?"
 flavor_eth.39.a:0 "We should take the mantle of the Aksumite Empire!"
 flavor_eth.39.b:0 "The advisers are right. We have to make our own footprints on this world!"
 flavor_eth.40.t:0 "The Kingdom Semien"
 flavor_eth.40.desc:2 "Back in the days when the Aksumite Empire ruled over these lands, there was a group of Jews, who refused to follow the true faith. They resisted Ezana's religious declaration and assembled revolts against the rightful emperor. Centuries later, the Jewish queen Gudit levied an army and destroyed the Aksumite Empire for good.\nThis all is long in the past, but the Beta Israeli remained a troublesome group - even for [Root.GetName]. We can try to convert them to [Root.Religion.GetName] though we will face heavy resistence from the Beta Israeli."
 flavor_eth.40.a:1 "Show them the way of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 flavor_eth.40.b:1 "We should not create a bigger rift between our people."
 flavor_eth.41.t:1 "The Journey over the Nile"
 flavor_eth.41.desc:1 "Usually most of our ambassadors travel by foot to Egypt and then take the next best boat to reach Europe. However, sometimes people grow bold and try different ways to reach a destination. Our current ambassador is one of them as he took a few galleys from our mighty fleet and traveled with them over the Nile. Fortunately for the ambassador, the Lord protected him from the danger of the great river and the infidels in the North and guided him to the Mediterranean Sea."
 flavor_eth.41.a:0 "I didn't think he would come so far."
 flavor_eth.42.t:0 "Contact with the Christians!"
 flavor_eth.42.desc:1 "After an additional 50 days of travel, the ambassador reached his goal: contact with the Christians of Europe! Although their views are quite heretical to us, our diplomats are just glad to be in contact with the outside world yet again. Additionally, these 'Catholics' share our ambition for a crusade against the Muslim threat, which makes them potential allies."
 flavor_eth.42.a:0 "God bless this ambassador and our new-found allies!"
 flavor_eth.43.t:0 "A strange Ambassador"
 flavor_eth.43.desc:1 "Our guards found a strange group of three galleys heading directly towards Rome this morning. After the men on the galleys confirmed that they were coming in peace, the interception fleet let them pass. Apparently, these people are fellow Christians and they are guarding a strange ambassador, who claims to have sailed the long way from Ethiopia over the mighty Nile.\nThe ambassador is here to restore the old contact between [From.GetName] and the Roman Empire!"
 flavor_eth.43.a:1 "Ethiopia? One moment... is he a servant of Prester John?!"
 flavor_eth.43.a.tt:0 "Discover all provinces from §Y[From.GetName]§!."
 flavor_eth.44.t:0 "Alliance with the Portuguese?"
 flavor_eth.44.desc:1 "[Root.GetName] had contact with the Portuguese before, but we never desired an alliance with them. But due to the circumstance that heathens are breathing down our neck and that the Catholic Pope is incapable of being helpful, our diplomats figured that it is a good idea to ally with the Portuguese. Our ambassador is only waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s command!"
 flavor_eth.44.a:0 "Sail, my son, and make them our alliance offer!"
 flavor_eth.44.b:0 "On a second thought... [Root.GetName] stands better without them."
 flavor_eth.45.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s Alliance Request"
 flavor_eth.45.desc:1 "A young diplomat from a foreign land reached the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and wishes for an audience! Apparently, the man is coming from the ancient land of [From.GetName]. As fellow Christians, he was sent to offer an alliance with us.\nWhile we are too far away from [From.GetName] to receive any beneficial help within Europe, [From.GetName] might still be a useful ally for our ambitions in the Indian Ocean."
 flavor_eth.45.a:0 "We should accept their offer."
 flavor_eth.45.a.at:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will receive access to the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! mercenary company if they get into a war with [ADA.GetName] and if [ADA.GetName] receives aid themselves."
 flavor_eth.45.b:0 "They might be useful, yes, but there are better allies than [From.GetName]."
 flavor_eth.46.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts the Alliance"
 flavor_eth.46.desc:0 "Our diplomat returns! With a glance of excitement in his eyes for achieving his first successful mission, he reports that the Portuguese are accepting the offer and wish to be our ally!"
 flavor_eth.46.a:1 "This is wonderful news!"
 flavor_eth.46.a.at:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will aid us in our war with [ADA.GetName] should [ADA.GetName] receive foreign aid themselves."
 flavor_eth.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses the ALliance"
 flavor_eth.47.desc:1 "Our diplomat returns! The look of the young man is one of disappointment. He reports that the Portuguese have no interest in an alliance with [Root.GetName] and sent our diplomat packing!"
 flavor_eth.47.a:1 "Don't worry. You gave your best. It's their loss, not ours."
 flavor_eth.48.t:0 "Modernization of an Army"
 flavor_eth.48.desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], our armies were able to modernize. Our troops have fully embraced the westernization of their fighting abilities!\nThey learned the strategies of the French Grande Armée.\nThey endured Prussian training.\nThey received Swiss guns.\nAnd now they are ready to fight for the glory of [Root.GetName]!"
 flavor_eth.48.a:0 "Glory to [Root.GetName]!"
 flavor_eth.49.t:0 "Support of the Ottoman"
 flavor_eth.49.desc:0 "In the great Ethiopian-Adal war in 1529, the Ottoman joined an alliance with the Sultanate Adal in order to defeat the Ethiopian Empire and to extinguish the last Christian bastion in the Horn of Africa. Although it wasn't a full blown war for the Ottomans, they supported Adal with several companies of Turkish soldiers."
 flavor_eth.49.ada.desc:0 "The war between [Root.GetName] and [ETH.GetName] rages on. Neither side seems to be a clear winner and at few fronts the [Root.GetAdjective] troops are even getting pushed back. Fortunately, we have prepared for this day. Turkish elite soldiers from Anatolia arrived in [Root.GetName] to join the fight against the Christian threat!"
 flavor_eth.49.a:0 "Blessed be the Ottomans for their help!"
 flavor_eth.49.a.tt:0 "Enables the §YOttoman Janissaries§! Mercenary Company."
 flavor_eth.50.t:0 "Support of the Portuguese"
 flavor_eth.50.desc:1 "The Ethiopian-Adal war has been a disaster for Ethiopia. Many towns got razed, the capital got sieged down by the combined power of Adal and the Ottoman Empire and the remaining army of Ethiopia had to retreat into the mountains. The Muslims assumed that it was only a matter of time until Ethiopia fell.\nThen the Portuguese arrived. In the year 1541, the Portuguese sent the commander Cristóvão da Gama with a company of Portuguese troops to assist Ethiopia and to fight against the Ottoman Empire. These new troops allowed Ethiopia to turn the tables and to defeat the vastly larger Muslim army, which led to the white peace in 1543."
 flavor_eth.50.a:0 "Thank God the Portuguese have come!"
 flavor_eth.50.a.tt:0 "Enables the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! Mercenary Company."
 flavor_eth.51.t:0 "End of the Portuguese-Ottoman Conflicts"
 flavor_eth.51.desc:1 "The Portuguese and the Ottoman had a long history of rivalry ever since the Ottoman Empire blocked the trade from the Silk Road to Europe. The first real fight, however, started when the Ottoman assisted the Sultanate of Gujarat in the siege of Diu in 1538. Ever since, these two great powers were at war with each other on several occasions with the Ethiopian-Adal war being the most prominent proxy war.\nAfter the small victory of Ethiopia, the Portuguese continued their wins against the Ottoman. In the year 1559, Suleiman the I had to recognize that decisive victories against the Portuguese were a futile project. Because of that, the militaristic activities of these two powers have been greatly reduced in the Horn of Africa."
 flavor_eth.51.a:0 "So be it."
 flavor_eth.51.a.tt:0 "The §YOttoman Janissaries§! and the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! Mercenary Companies are no longer available."
 flavor_eth.52.t:0 "Jesuit Activities in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_eth.52.desc:1 "In the years 1555 and 1557, the first Portuguese Jesuits arrived in Ethiopia. At first they intended to stand for the small Portuguese community, which has been growing in Ethiopia since 1543. However, their influence in the Ethiopian court grew. It went so far that the Catholic church started to become a real threat to the authority of the Coptic church and now they are trying to talk [Root.Monarch.GetName] into converting to Catholicism! How shall we deal with those foreign missionaries?"
 flavor_eth.52.a:0 "We shall banish these parasites!"
 flavor_eth.52.b:0 "They should be warned!"
 flavor_eth.52.c:1 "Maybe they are right. We should convert to Catholicism."

 flavor_mal.9.d:1 "After the death of Mansa Suleyman Keita, the brother of the mighty Mansa Musa, the empire of [Root.GetName] has seen a constant decline in power, influence and wealth over the decades. Civil wars, fights for the thrones and a series of incompetent mansas undermined the stability of [Root.GetName]. Former subjects such as the Songhai or the Timbuktu declared their independence from the empire, and even now the realm is seeing further and further fall in importance."
 flavor_mal.9.a:0 "These are dark times..."
 flavor_mal.10.t:0 "Return to former Glory for [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_mal.10.d:1 "Like a miracle, the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] survived the internal struggles for power between factions, convinced the subjects to remain loyal to the mansa and even united the royal court. Even better, the old borders of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] have been restored and, as such, the influence the realm once had in West Africa.\nNow it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to expand the power and influence of [Root.GetName] even beyond the achievements the mighty Mansa Musa reached!"

Thanks to its location, it allowed Aksum to become the major power of the Red Sea.\nWith the inevitable decay of the Aksumite Empire, so the city declined. But not all is lost though!

It connected the Roman Empire with the riches of India, which allowed the Romans to enjoy Indian goods without having the trouble to deal with the Persians. This changed though when its successor, the Byzantine Empire, fell to the constant onslaugt from the east. Ever since, the Red Sea is no longer as profitable as it once was - and due to the colonialism of the Europeans, it most likely will never be again.\nBut we still have options. Thanks to our new found connection with the Europeans it is possible for us to be present in their much more active trade nodes. All we need to do is reach their rich market one way or another."
