 ###ETH FLAVOR EVENTS###
 flavor_eth.37.t:1 "Restoration of Sukib"
 flavor_eth.37.desc:1 "Although the city fell into the Egyptian sphere of influence long ago, it remains an important center of trade and many Ethiopian have found their way to the city over the years. Over time, the city has become an Ethiopian enclave in all but name. It is time, that our rule over Sukib is formalized, so our brothers can be part of our great nation!"
 flavor_eth.37.a:1 "Blessed be these souls!"

 flavor_eth.39.t:1 "Surpassing of the Aksumite Borders"
 flavor_eth.39.desc:1 "Originally, the Aksumite Empire only had the Nubian region, North Ethiopian areas and the southern coast of Arabia. Borders which are no match to ours! [Root.Monarch.GetName] lead our [Root.GovernmentName] to many successful battles and to campaigns of war and now we not only have achieved the restoration of the old empire!\nWith these massive campaigns of conquest, many of our nobles plead for an official return to the name "Aksumite Empire" in order to show the world our strength by reclaiming the authority of that ancient empire. On the other hand, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisers recommend that we start looking into the future. How shall our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decide?"
 flavor_eth.39.a:1 "We should take the mantle of the Aksumite Empire!"
 flavor_eth.39.b:1 "The advisers are right. We have to make our own footprints on this world!"

 flavor_eth.40.t:1 "The Kingdom Semien"
 flavor_eth.40.desc:2 "Back in the days when the Aksumite Empire ruled over these lands, there was a group of Jews, who refused to follow the true faith. They resisted Ezana's religious declaration and assembled revolts against the rightful emperor. Centuries later, the Jewish queen Gudit levied an army and nearly destroyed the Aksumite Empire for good.\nThis all is long in the past, but the Beta Israeli remained a troublesome group - even for [Root.GetName]. We can try to convert them to [Root.Religion.GetName] though we will face heavy resistence from the Beta Israeli."
 flavor_eth.40.a:1 "Show them the way of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 flavor_eth.40.b:1 "We should not create a bigger rift between our people."

 flavor_eth.42.t:1 "Contact with Europe!"
 flavor_eth.42.desc:1 "After an additional 50 days of travel, the ambassador reached his goal: contact with the Powers of Europe! Although their views are quite heretical to us, our diplomats are just glad to be in contact with the outside world yet again. Additionally, these 'Catholics' share our ambition to break the powers of the upper Nile, which makes them potential allies."
 flavor_eth.42.a:1 "God bless this ambassador and our new-found allies!"

 flavor_eth.43.t:1 "A strange Ambassador"
 flavor_eth.43.desc:1 "Our guards found a strange group of three galleys heading directly towards Rome this morning. After the men on the galleys confirmed that they were coming in peace, the interception fleet let them pass. Apparently, these people are fellow Christians and they are guarding a strange ambassador, who claims to have sailed the long way from Ethiopia over the mighty Nile.\nThe ambassador is here to restore the old contact between [From.GetName] and the Roman Empire!"
 flavor_eth.43.a:1 "Ethiopia? One moment... we have not heard from them in centuries?!"
 flavor_eth.43.a.tt:1 "Discover all provinces from §Y[From.GetName]§!."

 flavor_eth.44.t:1 "Alliance with the Lusitanians?"
 flavor_eth.44.desc:1 "[Root.GetName] had contact with the Lusitanians before, but we never desired an alliance with them. But due to the circumstance that heretics are breathing down our neck and that the Catholic Pope is incapable of being helpful, our diplomats figured that it is a good idea to ally with the LusitaniansPortuguese. Our ambassador is only waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s command!"
 flavor_eth.44.a:1 "Sail, my son, and make them our alliance offer!"
 flavor_eth.44.b:1 "On a second thought... [Root.GetName] stands better without them."

 flavor_eth.45.t:1 "[From.GetName]'s Alliance Request"
 flavor_eth.45.desc:1 "A young diplomat from a foreign land reached the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and wishes for an audience! Apparently, the man is coming from the ancient land of [From.GetName]. As fellow Christians, he was sent to offer an alliance with us.\nWhile we are too far away from [From.GetName] to receive any beneficial help within Europe, [From.GetName] might still be a useful ally for our ambitions in the Indian Ocean."
 flavor_eth.45.a:1 "We should accept their offer."
 #flavor_eth.45.a.at:1 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will receive access to the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! mercenary company if they get into a war with [ADA.GetName] and if [ADA.GetName] receives aid themselves."
 flavor_eth.45.b:1 "They might be useful, yes, but there are better allies than [From.GetName]."

 flavor_eth.46.t:1 "[From.GetName] accepts the Alliance"
 flavor_eth.46.desc:1 "Our diplomat returns! With a glance of excitement in his eyes for achieving his first successful mission, he reports that the Lusitanians are accepting the offer and wish to be our ally!"
 flavor_eth.46.a:1 "This is wonderful news!"
 #flavor_eth.46.a.at:1 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will aid us in our war with [ADA.GetName] should [ADA.GetName] receive foreign aid themselves."

 flavor_eth.47.t:1 "[From.GetName] refuses the Alliance"
 flavor_eth.47.desc:1 "Our diplomat returns! The look of the young man is one of disappointment. He reports that the Lusitanians have no interest in an alliance with [Root.GetName] and sent our diplomat packing!"
 flavor_eth.47.a:1 "Don't worry. You gave your best. It's their loss, not ours."

 flavor_eth.52.t:1 "Jesuit Activities in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_eth.52.desc:1 "In the years 1555 and 1557, the first Lusitanian Jesuits arrived in Ethiopia. At first they intended to stand for the small Lusitanian community, which has been growing in Ethiopia since 1543. However, their influence in the Ethiopian court grew. It went so far that the Catholic church started to become a real threat to the authority of the Miaphysite church and now they are trying to talk [Root.Monarch.GetName] into converting to Catholicism! How shall we deal with those foreign missionaries?"
 flavor_eth.52.a:1 "We shall banish these parasites!"
 flavor_eth.52.b:1 "They should be warned!"
 flavor_eth.52.c:1 "Maybe they are right. We should convert to Catholicism."

 ###MAL FLAVOR EVENTS###
 flavor_mal.4.t:1 "The Wangara and the Lusitanians"
 flavor_mal.4.d:1 "Having adopted a less violent approach, Lusitanian traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western coasts. In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by Lusitanian merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the Lusitanian wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."
 flavor_mal.4.a:1 "Ok."

 flavor_mal.5.t:1 "Lusitanian Meddling"
 flavor_mal.5.d:1 "The Lusitanian traders on our western coast have become quite a nuisance lately. While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from far away countries are of great use to us it seems they cannot help but meddle in the local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the Lusitanian have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut the ties with our central administration.\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the Lusitanian."
 flavor_mal.5.a:1 "Act decisively to limit Lusitanian influence."
 flavor_mal.5.b:1 "The problem lies with the disloyal chiefs."

 flavor_mal.6.t:1 "Christanisation of the Aristocracy"
 flavor_mal.6.d:1 "While our rulers are Tadmunites since some time, the old religion of our forefathers is still very much a force to be reckoned with. Christanity has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the aristocracy and wandering Agwerrams have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\nIn the past our predecessors have all avoided trying to be too forceful about converting their subjects but if we wish we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."
 flavor_mal.6.a:1 "Let us convert our people!"
 flavor_mal.6.a.tt:1 "This option will unlock the §YTadmunite mission§! for [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_mal.6.b:1 "Let us not rock the boat."
 flavor_mal.6.b.tt:1 "This option will unlock the §YFetishist mission§! for [Root.GetName]."

 flavor_mal.9.t:1 "The Decline of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_mal.9.d:1 "After the death of Mansa Askel Keita, the brother of the mighty Mansa Musa, the empire of [Root.GetName] has seen a constant decline in power, influence and wealth over the decades. Civil wars, fights for the thrones and a series of incompetent mansas undermined the stability of [Root.GetName]. Former subjects such as the Songhai or the Timbuktu declared their independence from the empire, and even now the realm is seeing further and further fall in importance."
 flavor_mal.9.a:1 "These are dark times..."

 flavor_mal.11.t:1 "[Root.mal_pretender.GetName] challenges [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_mal.11.d:1 "Battles for the throne have been a common sight in [Root.GetName] since Askel's death. As such, it is to nobody's surprise that the ambitious general [Root.mal_pretender.GetName] tries to overthrow [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The general has gathered an army and is now sieging [mal_pretender_province.GetName]."
 flavor_mal.11.a:1 "You dare challenge me?"

 flavor_mal.28.t:1 "Timbuktu's Fate"
 flavor_mal.28.desc:1 "The city of Timbuktu played a major role in the West African region, as through it, the world south of the Tinariwen was introduced to the teachings of the Prophet Tadmun, and until recently it used to be the main connection between Europe and the Agisymba region. Now that we have regained control over the city, discussions have arisen over whether we should move our capital to this crucial trade city..."
 flavor_mal.28.a:1 "Make Timbuktu our capital."
 flavor_mal.28.b:1 "We should develop our current capital instead."
 can_colonize_the_strait_tt:1 "Enable a Decision, which allows us to colonize §Y[1127.GetName]§!."
 can_colonize_djado_and_tajarhi_tt:1 "Enable a Decision, which allows us to colonize §Y[2474.GetName]§! and §Y[2475.GetName]§!."

 flavor_mal.29.t:1 "The Small Cathedral of Djenné"
 flavor_mal.29.desc:1 "The Cathedral of the First Kings in Djenné is a regional wonder. It is a giant cathedral and many of our higher class make a pilgrimage to this holy building in order to pray. The church got it's perculiar nickname - the Small Cathedral of Djenné - due to it being fractionally smaller then it's counterpart in Timbuktu.\nLately though, the cathedral has been in a rough state. Fortunately for the city and the monument, our [Root.GetClergyName] have invested many of their resources into upgrading the cathedral and converting the local residents."
 flavor_mal.29.a:1 "Blessed be the [Root.GetClergyName]."

 flavor_mal.30.t:1 "[Root.GetName] and the Songhai"
 flavor_mal.30.desc:1 "Prior to 1430, the lands of Songhai were our subjects. In 1430, the [Root.GetName] lost control over the rich city Gao due to the problems and struggles in the homeland, and the city and its territory around it went rogue. They have been taken over by the reborn Zuwa dynasty and declared themselves a realm of their own, rivalling our power.\nBut that is now a thing of the past. Gao is again under our control and a majority of the ones who identify themselves as 'Songhai' are our subjects yet again."
 flavor_mal.30.a:1 "As it should be."
 flavor_mal.30.a.tt:1 "Every owned province of the §YSonghai§! culture gains §G-30§! Years of Separatism."

 flavor_mal.31.t:1 "[Root.GetName] and the Barbarie"
 flavor_mal.31.desc:1 "The Barbarie is home to a very old trading partner of [Root.GetName], although this is about to change as the situation of the Barbarie is precarious due to the European threat. Our African brothers seemed to have heard the wonderful stories of Mansa Musa and now ask us for support in the form of gold or ivory. Of course such support is quite costly, but the opportunity for a northern alliance might be worth it."
 flavor_mal.31.a:1 "Send them support in the form of gold."
 flavor_mal.31.b:1 "Subsidy them with ivory."
 flavor_mal.31.c:1 "Keep the gold and ivory for yourself."

 flavor_mal.37.t:1 "The generous Pilgrimage of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_mal.37.desc:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] travelled to the great city of [2469.GetName]. Just like how the great Mansa Musa once did, so did the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] bring the riches of [Root.GetName] to the city - although this time, with a lot less gold; after all, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not want to cause damage to our brethren in faith.\nWhen arriving at the city, the [Root.GetClergyName] recommended to donate the gold for the construction of a great cathedral, which shall compliment the tomb of the Prophet. On the other hand, some of the more compassionate advisors suggested investing in a counting house in [2469.GetName] so that the poor can help themselves to overcome their bad situation with the help of God."
 flavor_mal.37.a:1 "[2469.GetName] shall have a great cathedral!"
 flavor_mal.37.a.tt:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will invest [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] money in [2469.GetName] for the construction of a §YCathedral§!."
 flavor_mal.37.b:1 "The poor require more help than the [Root.GetClergyName]!"
 flavor_mal.37.b.tt:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will invest [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] money in [2469.GetName] for the construction of a §YCounting House§!."

 flavor_mal.38.t:1 "[From.Monarch.GetName] donates Gold for a Great Cathedral!"
 flavor_mal.38.desc:1 "The generous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] from [From.GetName] made a pilgrimage to our holy city of [2469.GetName] and donated unimaginable amounts of gold for the construction of a new great cathedral, which shall compliment the tomb of the Prophet!"
 flavor_mal.38.a:1 "Blessed be [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] wisdom!"

 flavor_mal.39.t:1 "[From.Monarch.GetName] donates Gold for a Counting House!"
 flavor_mal.39.desc:1 "The generous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] from [From.GetName] made a pilgrimage to our holy city of [2469.GetName] and donated tons of gold for the construction of a new counting house, which shall bring work and support for the poor!"
 flavor_mal.39.a:1 "Blessed be [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart!"

 flavor_mal.40.t:1 "A new Pilgrimage Route"
 flavor_mal.40.desc:1 "Many of our Mansas have travelled to Jerusalem in the past. Each time the Mansas took the classic way through Egypt and then along the coast. While it is the safest and fastest way, it is not a very exciting route. It would be like any other pilgrimage.\nBut the court came up with a new idea: a grand tour to Jerusalem through the rest of the Christian world to see the wonders of Europe and back through kingdom of the heathen Muslims, down the Red Sea of legend and home through the mythical land of Aksum."
 flavor_mal.40.a:1 "I am looking forward to seeing Europe!"
 flavor_mal.40.a.tt:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will travel to Jerusalem by a route through Europe.\n§YThe Pilgrimage can end prematurely if [Root.Monarch.GetName] dies during the journey.§!"
 flavor_mal.40.b:1 "I think a pilgrimage of this scale should be done by my advisors instead."
 flavor_mal.40.b.tt:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors will take the route through Europe instead."
 flavor_mal.40.c:1 "I prefer the classic route though."
 flavor_mal.40.c.tt:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will take the traditional route to Jerusalem instead."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] spent [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time visiting the grand fortified city of Aït Benhaddou in Demnat.

The new [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] that we inherited from the Air and that follow this new Religion called Christianity, however stress that it would be a benefit for [Root.GetName] to embrace this new way, and their God and prophet. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is intrigued by what he hears from this new God, but should he really abandon the ancient ways?\nIn the end it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide the fate of these people and the religious direction of [Root.GetName]."

 flavor_son.6.d:1 "Koy Kimi was the 15th ruler of the restored Zuwa dynasty and the one who would go down in history as the first proper king of Songhai. During his reign many great cities such as Djenné or Timbuktu fell to Songhai's armies and the kingdom developed into the empire, which shall replace Mali as the hegemon of West Africa. Though he had Tadmunite tutors and advisor, he stayed true to the old ways, and he became infamous repressive policy against the scholars of Timbuktu and his preferance for the traditional religions."

Due to the efforts of the [Root.GetAdjective] workers it was possible to restore the cathedral to its former glory except for one detail: the original design of the cathedral incorporated many expensive decorations in the Mauritanian style, but these decorations had been destroyed during the war.\nThe [Root.GetClergyName] argue that a restoration of this decoration is necessary to show our devotion to the Lord. However, the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] stress out that the temples of other religions do not get the same treatment of decorations and as such the Great Cathedral shall be treated as equal."

It was thought to be impossible for our ruling class to accompdate for all the religions, but they are determined to try exactly that. There has to be room for followers of the traditional faiths and Christanity in our nation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to consider how to accompish this ambitious goal, for the glory of our nation [Root.GetName]..."

One of these is the ancient city Brim, which served in the 8th century as the center of Christianity.

Shortly after, the northern parts of the Empire fell apart in several tribes.\nBut now we have a new dynasty on the throne and challenge the old failing fools in Zeila for the title of 'King of all Kings' and as such we will reconquer the territories of our fallen predecessor - starting with the unification of the tribes!"

Although the port never officially used to be part of Aksumite Empire, it still has been a home to many [Root.GetAdjective]s until the city fell into the hands of the Beja.

Our great nation was once part of the Aksumite Empire - until we broke away in an rebellion. It's glory days have long been over, thanks to the pressure from every direction.\nWithout owning the place of the crowning, our rulers miss legitimacy.

It connected the Roman Empire with the riches of India, which allowed the Romans to enjoy Indian goods without having the trouble to deal with the Persians. This changed though when its successor, the Byzantine Empire, declined to the constant onslaugt from the east and had to abandon most of it's Oriental posessions. Ever since, the Red Sea is no longer as profitable as it once was - and due to the colonialism of the Europeans, it most likely will never be again.\nBut we still have options. Thanks to our new found connection with the Europeans it is possible for us to be present in their much more active trade nodes. All we need to do is reach their rich market one way or another."

His strong message and his charismatic person has impressed parts of our population, but the lack of evidence for successful jihads in the west limits his success. Still, the scholar's popularity made the Fulani culture within our country very popular - an event which baffles even our brightest advisors."

Then, my king, shall we send an embassy to this overseas, far away land, to ascertain if these stories are true? Or maybe it's a risk sending them into the mainland, and we should be content with our ongoing trade activity in known seas?"

 flavor_zan.14.t:1 "[From.GetName] lost the [Root.GetAdjective] embassy!"

 flavor_zan.16.desc:1 "The trade route established by our merchants with the distant country of [OppositeEmbassyHolderName] has paid off the effort of establishing our embassy there. But apart from trade goods and money, there is something more interesting that has begun to be shared between our two peoples: ideas. Thus, it has been very beneficial for the development of our country in the past few years, my king."

 flavor_zan.17.t:1 "Religious Interactions"
 flavor_zan.17.desc:1 "The embassy established some years ago has also given us some information about the beliefs of the people in [OppositeEmbassyHolderName], which is not so different from our own beliefs.
