 tengri_devout_muslim:1 "Devout Christian"
 desc_tengri_devout_muslim:1 "The concerned Christians of our country have now found it in themselves to trust our leadership after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] adopted a much stricter set of Christian rules for life at court. However, this insistence on Christian ritual and tradition has made many of our more traditional subjects doubt our right to rule them."
 tengri_events.12.t:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Questioned by the Clergy"
 tengri_events.12.d:1 "Our adoption of Christianity has not been without friction. While its favored status has made the Christian community grow in our lands, many remain uneasy with their one god. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has shown great interest in the foreign religion but still practices many of the rituals of our ancestors. Perhaps it is because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes such interest in them that the Christian community itself has come to scrutinize the life and actions of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Christian community leaders question whether [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions are really made with the best interests of them and their god in mind."
 tengri_events.12.a:1 "Vow to lead a more devout life."
 tengri_events.12.b:1 "Our [Root.Religion.GetName] traditions must come first."
 tengri_events.12.b.tt:1 "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! Faith will suffer §R5§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.13.t:1 "Incident at Court"
 tengri_events.13.d:1 "In an unfortunate gaffe, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to upset the Christian community of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by including their leaders in a [Root.Religion.GetName] ceremony. While this act was intended entirely as an honor, it has resulted in some very sore feelings among the Christians in our capital and elsewhere."
 tengri_events.13.a:1 "Ok."
 support_of_the_khojas:1 "Support of the Khwoja"
 desc_support_of_the_khojas:1 "Our ruler has the support of the current descendant of the line of powerful mystic Khwojas that hold great influence in our lands."
 tengri_expel_the_khojas_title:1 "Expel the Khwojas"
 tengri_expel_the_khojas_desc:1 "Over time, the influence of the Khwoja and his descendants have grown dangerously strong in our country. Now that they do not have the ear of our ruler, we can forcibly expel them from our lands, avoiding future conflicts."
 tengri_events.16.t:1 "Popular Mystic Teacher"
 tengri_events.16.d:1 "A teacher of a lineage of famous mystics has recently gained increasing popularity in our lands. His teachings have not only won the ears of our Christian communities but also have deeply impressed the more traditional warrior elites. Many that listen to his words will still not forsake the Tengri Shamans but the teacher's charismatic personality ensures that even so they will value every word of this 'Khwoja'. A local noble that managed to come into conflict with the Khwoja lost so badly he had to abandon his lands.\nSo far, the Khwoja have been quietly supporting our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps he could be persuaded to support the throne a bit more openly if we grant him land and an official title at our court?"
 tengri_events.16.a.tt:1 "Every future ruler will be offered this modifier, but the Khwoja or his descendants may well try to take power themselves eventually."
 tengri_events.16.b.tt:1 "The Khwoja and his descendants will not bother us again."
 tengri_events.17.t:1 "The Khwojas"
 tengri_events.17.d:1 "The influence of the Khwoja lineage over our subjects is almost dreadful. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy, and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khwoja is, however, still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khwoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
 tengri_events.17.a.tt:1 "This will strengthen the Khwoja and increase the likeliness of him or his successors attempting to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.17.b:1 "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khwojas."
 tengri_events.17.b.tt:1 "This will weaken the influence of the Khwojas and their chances to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.18.t:1 "The Khwoja takes power"
 tengri_events.18.d:1 "Not content to merely serve as the power behind the throne, the current head of the Khwoja lineage has officially declared himself to be more qualified to rule than any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. His loyal followers are massing on the outskirts of our capital as well as in the countryside, attempting to create a state built directly upon the teachings of their charismatic mystic teacher."
 tengri_events.19.t:1 "Manichaean Diaspora"
 tengri_events.19.d:1 "While there is ample doubt about the sincerity of our conviction, the word of our conversion has spread among the Manichaean communities around the world. Small groups of Manichaeans have begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking to help build and protect a state for those that honor the Prophets.\nTheir services might come in quite handy. However, our Shamans are apprehensive about allowing what they see as foreign zealots to settle among our people."
 tengri_events.19.a:1 "Settle them near our capital."
 tengri_events.19.b:1 "Settle them in the countryside."
 tengri_events.19.c:1 "Turn them away."
 tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:1 "Manichaean Immigration"
 desc_tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:1 "We have allowed Manichaean minorities from other countries that come to our lands seeking to start a new life here to settle in and around our capital. Our capital is growing as a result, but Tengri Shamans and traditionalist fear their influence over our politics."
 tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:0 "Manichaean Immigration"
 desc_tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:0 "We have allowed Manichaean minorities from other countries that come to our lands seeking to start a new life here to settle in and around our capital. Our capital is growing as a result, but Tengri Shamans and traditionalist fear their influence over our politics."
 tengri_events.38.t:1 "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d:1 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church, the Coptic Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances, the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries and quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a:1 "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.38.b:1 "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.47.t:1 "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d:1 "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact, to a certain extent, it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.50.t:1 "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d:1 "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a large number of Zoroastrians from across the Eranian world. Ever since the rise of Christianity within the Eranian heartland half a millennium ago, they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.61.d:1 "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."
 tengri_events.62.t:1 "Protection of Pilgrims"
 tengri_events.62.d:1 "Our frequent wars have made the faithful Manichaeans of our state reluctant to undertake pilgrimages to the holy cities. While faith may frequently overcome fear, it is true that pilgrims passing through our lands are often attacked, and their journey is often a perilous ordeal."
 tengri_events.62.a:1 "We must ensure their safety."
 tengri_events.62.b:1 "Their faith will protect them."
 tengri_events.63.t:1 "Influence of the Khwojas"
 tengri_events.63.d:1 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khwojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khwoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us, but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."
 tengri_events.63.a:1 "There is nothing to be done right now."
 tengri_events.63.b:1 "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khwojas."
