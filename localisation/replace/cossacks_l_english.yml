 tengri_events.9.t:1 "Parmanag"
 tengri_events.9.d:1 "The Manichaean community of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] is home to many religious scholars, men of learning who interpret the holy texts and the ways they can be used to rule fairly and righteously in legal matters. Due to the great influence of the Manichaeans in our society at large, the results of these scholars are starting to spread throughout our country and have a profound effect on the view of rulership and righteousness."
 tengri_ibadi_scholars:1 "Parmanag"
 desc_tengri_ibadi_scholars:1 "By supporting the Manichaean scholarly community and attempting to live up to their ideas of leadership and righteousness, we have managed to increase our support for our ruler."
 tengri_events.10.t:1 "Traveling Mystics"
 tengri_events.10.d:1 "Opening up our country to the influences of Christianity has attracted a trickle of persons from the wider Christian world. Christian merchants now make deeper inroads into our countryside, and traveling mystics have become a more common sight among our settlements. At times, it is possible to track the path of such holy men by the converts they leave behind as they move from one area to the next. Some of these men are already famous when they come to our lands and possess a way to mobilize the heart and will of men to follow a ruler they see as just.\nOne particularly famous mystic teacher has recently arrived in our lands."
 tengri_events.10.a:1 "Encourage him to settle in our capital."
 tengri_events.10.b:1 "Encourage him to seek a patron elsewhere."
 tengri_sufi_teacher:1 "Mystic Master"
 desc_tengri_sufi_teacher:1 "A charismatic Christian teacher has settled in our capital, enriching our faith and placing our country on the spiritual map."
 tengri_devout_muslim:1 "Devout Christian"
 desc_tengri_devout_muslim:1 "The concerned Christians of our country have now found it in themselves to trust our leadership after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] adopted a much stricter set of Christian rules for life at court. However, this insistence on Christian ritual and tradition has made many of our more traditional subjects doubt our right to rule them."
 tengri_events.11.t:1 "Arrival of a Learned Judge"
 tengri_events.11.d:1 "A man with extensive experience as a judge in other Christian countries has arrived in our lands. He says that he is willing to settle in our lands for a while and act in his old profession, dispensing justice according to the cannon, ensuring law and order in our lands. This would no doubt be popular, especially among the Christian community in our country. His experience in other countries might also help centralize our realm."
 tengri_events.11.a:1 "Allow him to stay."
 tengri_qadi:1 "Learned Judge"
 desc_tengri_qadi:1 "A learned judge has settled in our capital, acting as an arbiter of justice in many matters. He has facilitated the growth of central authority in our state. The traditionalists, however, view his presence as an affront to our old values and to the law codes of our ancestors."
 tengri_events.12.t:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Questioned by the Clergy"
 tengri_events.12.d:1 "Our adoption of Christianity has not been without friction. While its favored status has made the Christian community grow in our lands, many remain uneasy with their one god. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has shown great interest in the foreign religion but still practices many of the rituals of our ancestors. Perhaps it is because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes such interest in them that the Christian community itself has come to scrutinize the life and actions of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Christian community leaders question whether [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions are really made with the best interests of them and their god in mind."
 tengri_events.12.a:1 "Vow to lead a more devout life."
 tengri_events.12.b:1 "Our [Root.Religion.GetName] traditions must come first."
 tengri_events.12.b.tt:1 "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! Faith will suffer §R5§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.13.t:1 "Incident at Court"
 tengri_events.13.d:1 "In an unfortunate gaffe, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to upset the Christian community of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by including their leaders in a [Root.Religion.GetName] ceremony. While this act was intended entirely as an honor, it has resulted in some very sore feelings among the Christians in our capital and elsewhere."
 tengri_events.13.a:1 "Ok."
 support_of_the_khojas:1 "Support of the Khwoja"
 desc_support_of_the_khojas:1 "Our ruler has the support of the current descendant of the line of powerful mystic Khwojas that hold great influence in our lands."
 tengri_expel_the_khojas_title:1 "Expel the Khwojas"
 tengri_expel_the_khojas_desc:1 "Over time, the influence of the Khwoja and his descendants have grown dangerously strong in our country. Now that they do not have the ear of our ruler, we can forcibly expel them from our lands, avoiding future conflicts."
 tengri_events.14.t:1 "Warriors of the Faith"
 tengri_events.14.d:1 "Our country is in some ways at the frontier of the Manichaean world and, as such, mostly attracts the attention of traveling monks or merchants. It seems, however, that a fervent preacher has managed to convince a large group of warriors to submit to this foreign god, and these men are now taking part in our current wars against their religious enemies with a newfound fervor."
 tengri_events.14.a:1 "Great!"
 tengri_jihad:1 "Religious Warriors"
 desc_tengri_jihad:1 "The spread of Manichaeism among our warriors has left them with a newfound fervor in their struggle against our religious enemies."
 tengri_events.15.t:1 "Conflict between Cities and Nomads"
 tengri_events.15.d:1 "With the increasing influence of Christianity, especially in our growing cities, the older legal codes such as the Yassa have increasingly come to be abandoned in favor of Canon law that our Christian urban dwellers prefer.\nThis development has recently resulted in a heated legal battle in [Root.GetName], where an important warrior from a local clan insists on his rights according to tradition while the urban establishment insists on following Canon law. Supporting one side over the other will undoubtedly have repercussions for the development of the entire area."
 tengri_events.15.a:1 "Appoint a Christian judge to the case."
 tengri_events.15.b:1 "Appoint someone to judge according to our traditions."
 tengri_growing_cities:1 "Growing Cities"
 desc_tengri_growing_cities:1 "By ruling in favor of their rights, we have strengthened the urban community in this region, and as a result, it is growing nicely. Their gratitude also ensures that they are much more forthcoming with their tax payments."
 tengri_strengthened_local_clans:1 "Strengthened Clan"
 desc_tengri_strengthened_local_clans:1 "By ruling in favor of their rights, we have strengthened our ties to the local warriors in this region, and as a result, they are more than willing to help us in the future."
 tengri_events.16.t:1 "Popular Mystic Teacher"
 tengri_events.16.d:1 "A teacher of a lineage of famous mystics has recently gained increasing popularity in our lands. His teachings have not only won the ears of our Christian communities but also have deeply impressed the more traditional warrior elites. Many that listen to his words will still not forsake the Tengri Shamans but the teacher's charismatic personality ensures that even so they will value every word of this 'Khwoja'. A local noble that managed to come into conflict with the Khwoja lost so badly he had to abandon his lands.\nSo far, the Khwoja have been quietly supporting our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps he could be persuaded to support the throne a bit more openly if we grant him land and an official title at our court?"
 tengri_events.16.a.tt:1 "Every future ruler will be offered this modifier, but the Khwoja or his descendants may well try to take power themselves eventually."
 tengri_events.16.b.tt:1 "The Khwoja and his descendants will not bother us again."
 tengri_events.17.t:1 "The Khwojas"
 tengri_events.17.d:1 "The influence of the Khwoja lineage over our subjects is almost dreadful. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy, and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khwoja is, however, still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khwoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
 tengri_events.17.a.tt:1 "This will strengthen the Khwoja and increase the likeliness of him or his successors attempting to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.17.b:1 "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khwojas."
 tengri_events.17.b.tt:1 "This will weaken the influence of the Khwojas and their chances to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.18.t:1 "The Khwoja takes power"
 tengri_events.18.d:1 "Not content to merely serve as the power behind the throne, the current head of the Khwoja lineage has officially declared himself to be more qualified to rule than any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. His loyal followers are massing on the outskirts of our capital as well as in the countryside, attempting to create a state built directly upon the teachings of their charismatic mystic teacher."
 tengri_events.19.t:1 "Manichaean Diaspora"
 tengri_events.19.d:1 "While there is ample doubt about the sincerity of our conviction, the word of our conversion has spread among the Manichaean communities around the world. Small groups of Manichaeans have begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking to help build and protect a state for those that honor the Prophets.\nTheir services might come in quite handy. However, our Shamans are apprehensive about allowing what they see as foreign zealots to settle among our people."
 tengri_events.19.a:1 "Settle them near our capital."
 tengri_events.19.b:1 "Settle them in the countryside."
 tengri_events.19.c:1 "Turn them away."
 tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:1 "Manichaean Immigration"
 desc_tengri_shiite_settled_in_capital:1 "We have allowed Manichaean minorities from other countries that come to our lands seeking to start a new life here to settle in and around our capital. Our capital is growing as a result, but Tengri Shamans and traditionalist fear their influence over our politics."
 tengri_shiite_immigration:1 "Manichaean Immigration"
 desc_tengri_shiite_immigration:1 "A stream of followers of the Manichaean faith have come to our lands hoping to realize their dream of a state matching their ideals. Their willingness to protect their new homes has created a good recruiting base for our armies."
 tengri_events.23.d:1 "For some time, Vajrayana monks have been gaining followers in the province of [Root.GetName], and while their influence is still quite limited, they have apparently taken it upon themselves to go one step further in their missionary activity. Reports are reaching [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] of the destruction and incineration of our ancestral idols. However, the general reception of this policy has not turned out as the monks would have hoped, as the locals are now defending themselves from both the monks and the central authority that favors them."
 tengri_events.38.t:1 "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d:1 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church, the Miaphysite Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances, the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries and quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a:1 "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.39.t:1 "Papal Embassy"
 tengri_events.39.d:1 "An official Papal embassy has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The task of the envoys is to judge the sincerity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to once again hear him accept the pope as the head of the church and to include [Root.Monarch.GetName] into the wider Catholic community.\nIn order to achieve this, the envoys have brought with them a number of books, maps, and learned men. Surely, these men are also spies, eager to learn our secrets. It is also certain that our Shamans will disagree with any policy of bowing to a foreign head of religion and refusing them an audience would please them. But perhaps the knowledge these Catholics bring can make up for missing that opportunity."
 tengri_events.39.a:1 "Send these spies back home!"
 tengri_events.39.b:1 "We are loyal followers of the Roman Church."
 tengri_events.38.b:1 "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.47.t:1 "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d:1 "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact, to a certain extent, it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.50.t:1 "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d:1 "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a large number of Zoroastrians from across the Eranian world. Ever since the rise of Christianity within the Eranian heartland half a millennium ago, they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.57.t:1 "New Bible Translation"
 tengri_events.57.d:1 "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 tengri_events.57.a:1 "Great!"
 tengri_events.59.t:1 "Monastery Established"
 tengri_events.59.d:1 "Some way back, a number of our most pious Orthodox monks left the areas under our control in order to create a fortified frontier monastery in the wilder parts of the lands we border. The story of their success has attracted a number of believers to join them. Their settlement is now growing and will soon be noteworthy. Perhaps now would be a good time to claim the land for ourselves so that these settlers don't forget where they came from?"
 tengri_events.60.t:1 "Arrival of a Rich Merchant"
 tengri_events.60.d:1 "Eager to make a good profit from the various goods available in our lands, merchants from the wider Manichaean world continue to seek out our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One such man is now claiming that we are not doing enough to capitalize on the resources under our control. For a modest fee, he is offering to act as our agent in all contacts with foreign merchants in general and the influential finance groups such as the Abakhshayidani in particular."
 tengri_events.60.a:1 "Interesting."
 tengri_events.61.d:1 "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."
 tengri_events.62.t:1 "Protection of Pilgrims"
 tengri_events.62.d:1 "Our frequent wars have made the faithful Manichaeans of our state reluctant to undertake pilgrimages to the holy cities. While faith may frequently overcome fear, it is true that pilgrims passing through our lands are often attacked, and their journey is often a perilous ordeal."
 tengri_events.62.a:1 "We must ensure their safety."
 tengri_events.62.b:1 "Their faith will protect them."
 tengri_events.63.t:1 "Influence of the Khwojas"
 tengri_events.63.d:1 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khwojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khwoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us, but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."
 tengri_events.63.a:1 "There is nothing to be done right now."
 tengri_events.63.b:1 "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khwojas."
