 string_start_great_ming:0 "§YAdai Borjigin§! is closing in on his sixties. He has given the rising §YMing§! a lot of trouble already. Not one too grand at scheming and diplomacy, he mastery of the art of war has been quelling attempts from §YQizhen Zhu§! to rise to prominence by manipulating the §YRed Turbans§!. Regardless, if a spear isn't going to do it, age is certain to eventually defeat the mighty §YKhagan§!. \nFrom their base base in §YJiangsu Province§!, the §YZhu§! clan has been chipping away at the invasive §YYuan§! for decades now, growing to a fine state in the center of the world's greatest empire. The §YHan§! people flock to them, seeking to end the §YMongol§! rule once and for all. Coordinated rebellions in the form of the §YRed Turbans§! have been giving them a much necessary time to defeat weaker provincial governor neighbors. And the authorities in §YKhanbaliq§! - or §YBeijing§!, as it was once called and soon might be again - have not been able to stop the creeping §YMing's§! advance. Until §YAdai§!, that is. But his son §YTaisun§! is showing the many signs the §YZhus§! are all too accustomed to abuse from the §YYuan§! - inbreeding in an attempt to keep the "holiness" of their heavenly mandate (and possibly a lot of paranoia and fear of the courtesans growing too influent) being the most noticeable one. \nYet this time, the winds flow differently, and there is a sense of urgency in the air. No more skirmishes - the §YMing§! plans for all-out war, claiming the §YMandate of the Heavens§! has clearly abandoned the §YBorjigins§!. Deals with the §YZhou§! clan of §YNanjing§! has secured their court standings and granted them two quick-witted generals to lead in the fight for the freedom of the §YHan§! people. Their tax base surpasses that of the §YYuan§!. If they can counter against the mighty horsemen of the steppes, victory might seem inevitable. \nAs the dusk of the yellow sky approaches, the red one seems to rise in it's place. And all it takes is a few more years, one disease, one fatality."
 string_start_east_asia_description:1 "It seems fate itself does not like to give the §YMiddle Kingdom§! - §YChina§! - a break. Ever since the early days of the §YHan§! people, it seems it's resting point is that of chaos, regional governors, and corrupt rulers. Great unifier after great unifier has come and gone, and yet it always seemed to collapse into multiple entities. Governors declare independence, barbarians invade, the region gets fractured. This time it's not different - the §YMongols§! of the §YYuan§! dynasty invaded and secured their place in history. And now, the very same §YMongols§! are fighting to keep what's left of their §YEmpire§! whole, as warlords stake their claims to their regions, if not the whole §YEmpire§!. \nWhat is new, though, in the insertion of many different faiths, coming from the West to seek to proselytize inside §YChinese§! borders. Many warlord's peasants have converted, some warlords followed suit, and the religion question seems to be moving towards being a major point of content in the upcoming warlord era. \nTo the North, the remains of the §YYuan§! are at the knife's edge, but still in control, with the loyalists of §YJin§! assisting them, and the §YQin§! taking the blunt of the religious drama. In the center, the §YZhu§! clan has secured their power base, one much greater than that of all the others, rivaling central authority, threatening the §YWu§! in §YJiangdong§!. The South is still full of smaller, pettier governors, the most notable one being the rising §YYue§!, having just engaged on converting to a new faith, as well as the §YMin§!, essentially ruled by a junta of military officers. \nThe sand castle might finally come crashing down as the §YKhagan§!, §YAdai§!, approaches his late years. Whether it is the court intrigue that is going to displace him, or an invasion from one of the rival warlords - or even if he is going to be displaced, to begin with - it's clear that stability is almost certainly not going to mark the next few decades."
 string_start_tag_middle_east: "The lands of §YMesopotamia§! and the greater §YLevant§! are in turmoil.\n\nEver since the fall of the §YIlkhanate§!, numerous tribes and former Ilkhan vassal-states have established for themselves kingdoms and federations which rule over numerous people groups and even more numerous religious groups. On the coast, the kingdom of §YLebanon§!, which follows the §YMonothelite§! sect of Christianity, rules over the cities of §YDamascus§! and §YTripoli§!. To their south, the tribesmen of the White Sheep, the §YAq Qoyunlu§!, have recently raided the kingdom of §YEgypt§!, and currently control both the ancient city of §YAlexandria§! and the holy city of §YJerusalem§!. Though their control of these cities brings them great prestige, they are still tribal at heart, and their lands are incredibly religiously divided.\n\nRuling over Mesopotamia proper are the §YJalayirids§! and their vassal state of §YNahraya§!. The controller of the city of §YMahuza§!, which houses the §YNestorian See§!, Nahraya has recently been granted more autonomy by their Mongol-descended overlords - but even this may not be enough to keep them from revolting.\n\nJust outside of the Near East, there are numerous hostile states which would love nothing more than to move into the region and seize the wealth - and prestige - associated with it. In Arabia, Muslim tribes remain, and have been biding their time, waiting for the perfect time to strike. To the northwest, of course, is the Purple Phoenix, §YByzantium§!, weakened but ferocious, ready to rise again from the ashes of its former self. And, of course, to the east, the newly-establish §YAfsharid§! dynasty of §YPersia§! looks west, and may very well wish to light the fires in Mahuza - or §YCtesiphon§! - once more."
