Rather, they seek to bring down the Empire for personal gain, whether for more autonomy or to take the jade throne for themselves. The §YRed Turban§! rebels, while no longer rising up, are still supporting the §YZhu§! family's bid for the throne, and their warlord state has grown far faster than the rest. With a strong militia or loyal and hardened soldiers backing them up, their shot is a very solid one.\n\nUp north, near the §YMongol§! homelands and the northern capital - now called §YKhanbaliq§! - the authority of the §YGreat Khan§! is still maintained. The sons of §YTemüjin Khan§! are not sitting idly as their work collapses. Reforms have been implemented, and rebellions suppressed. But court intrigue is also starting to wear it down, as the next in line for the throne is still a young child that the court eunuchs are often trying to undermine the legitimacy and authority of, while also sabotaging his education.\n\nEverything is paving the way for a long and drawn-out battle for the throne."

 string_start_tag_middle_east: "The lands of Mesopotamia and the greater Levant are in turmoil.\n\nEver since the fall of the §YIlkhanate§!, numerous tribes and former Ilkhan vassal-states have established for themselves kingdoms and federations which rule over numerous people groups and even more numerous religious groups. On the coast, the kingdom of §YLebanon§!, which follows the §YMonothelite§! sect of Christianity, rules over the cities of §YDamascus§! and §YTripoli§!. To their south, the tribesmen of the White Sheep, the §YAq Qoyunlu§!, have recently raided the kingdom of §YEgypt§!, and currently control both the ancient city of §YAlexandria§! and the holy city of §YJerusalem§!. Though their control of these cities brings them great prestige, they are still tribal at heart, and their lands are incredibly religiously divided.\n\nRuling over Mesopotamia proper are the §YJalayirids§! and their vassal state of §YNahraya§!. As controller of the city of Mahuza, which houses the §YNestorian See§!, Nahraya has recently been granted more autonomy by their Mongol-descended overlords- but even this may not be enough to keep them from revolting.\n\nJust outside of the Near East, there are numerous hostile states which would love nothing more than to move into the region and seize the wealth - and prestige - associated with the region. In Arabia, Muslim tribes remain, and have been biding their time, waiting for the perfect time to strike. To the northwest, of course, is the Purple Phoenix, weakened but ferocious, ready to rise again from the ashes of its former self. And, of course, to the east, the newly-establish §YAfsharid§! dynasty of §YPersia§! looks west, and may very well wish to light the fires in Mahuza - or §YCtesiphon§! - once more."
