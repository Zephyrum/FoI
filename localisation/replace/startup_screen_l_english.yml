 string_start_tag_oceania:1 "In many parts of the world [GetYear] is a crucial year. In Europe, the stalemate between the three emperors of §YByzantium§!, §YBulgaria§! and the §YHRE§! seems to be finally coming to an end, which will surely change the political landscape of the continent forever. In Asia, the §YYuan§! emperors are constantly loosing power, and the many States of India are trying to gain an upper hand now that the Shahs face one crisis after the other. In the Americas, the §YAztec§! and §YIncan§! Empires have begun to form.\n\nIn Oceania, however, we know very little about what is going on. It will be up to you to make the region relevant to the rest of the world – most likely you will have to do so with sword in hand."
 string_start_tag_africa:1 "§YAfrica§! is home to far too many natural barriers and latitudinal differences, and as such, it's many regions face very distinct differences in all scopes: religious, ethnic, societal, developmental, and much more. It's a collateral effect of the massive deserts and lush jungles, alongside mountains, rivers and lakes, that dot the continent.\n\nWest Africa is home to a number of rising kingdoms, such as §YSonghai§! or §YBornu§!, as well as waning states, such as the §YMali§! Empire, all trying to make a living out of the gold and salt trade, and the expansion of the Tadmunite religion ever farther south, will surely have unexpected consequences on the region.\n\nThe Barbarie seems to be finally recovering from the aftermath of the crusades against the §YImwehheddens§!, and only time can tell, which nation will rise to dominance in the region, while in Egypt the power struggle between the invading Turks of the §YAq Qoyunlu§! and the §YPharaos§! in Memphis is in full swing.\n\nIn the east, §YAxum§! is still dominating the Horn of Africa, but with waning Egyptian influence and the rise of the §YEthiopians§! maps are about to be redrawn, with the §YSomali§! states remaining as spectators - for now.\n\nEven further South, the eastern jungles of the §YKongo§! serve as home to peoples unspoiled by §YChristianity§! or advanced non-tribal societies, while in the West the maritime §YMiaphysite§! Kingdom of §YKilwa§! is desperately trying to control and convert the lesser Kingozi kingdoms on the coast, and butting heads with the local fetishist monarchs and tribes.\n\nBy the Great Lakes, the lacustrine kingdoms fight over the lands of the mysterious, yet long gone Kitara Empire, while the §YMutapa§! and §YMarawi§! kingdoms try to assert their authority over the Zambezi."
 string_start_tag_asia:1 "Asia is a huge continent, and in [GetYear] it is inhabited by a number of diverse peoples.\n\nIn the west, the §YByzantines§! seem to be finally ready to reclaim dominance over Anatolia, while §YPersia§! faces serious religious turmoil, leaving room to a number of new promising states and would-be empires from Azerbaijan to Central Asia and India.\n\nIn the far East, the §YYuan§!, are wavering and struggle to maintain their hold over the Empire of China and has mostly given up on it's southern Territories, to prevent further loss of control in the north.\n\nThe island of §YJapan§! is rife with conflict, as a number of weakening Shoguns have left the country open to self-made Daimyo, local strong men from smaller clans."

This make Sweden-Norway into a powerful force, ready, to not only dominate the broken remnants of §YDenmark§! once and for all, but to expand their realm into new lands.\n\nThe §YRussian§! states are barely starting to feel free of the Tatar yoke, as the §YGolden Horde§! continues to fracture, ever since the start of it's succession crisis and civil war.\n\nAs the High Renaissance approaches, §YItaly§! and §YGermany§! remain fraught by the constant friction between the §YEmperor§! and the many autonomous princes.\n\nThe entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§!

 #Regions
 string_start_tag_middle_east: "The lands of §YMesopotamia§! and the greater §YLevant§! are in turmoil.\n\nEver since the fall of the §YIlkhanate§!, numerous tribes and former Ilkhan vassal-states have established for themselves kingdoms and federations which rule over numerous people groups and even more numerous religious groups. On the coast, the kingdom of §YLebanon§!, which follows the §YMonothelite§! sect of Christianity, rules over the cities of §YDamascus§! and §YTripoli§!. To their south, the tribesmen of the White Sheep, the §YAq Qoyunlu§!, have recently raided the kingdom of §YEgypt§!, and currently control both the ancient city of §YAlexandria§! and the holy city of §YJerusalem§!. Though their control of these cities brings them great prestige, they are still tribal at heart, and their lands are incredibly religiously divided.\n\nRuling over Mesopotamia proper are the §YJalayirids§! and their vassal state of §YBeth Nahrain§!. The controller of the city of §YMahuza§!, which houses the §YNestorian See§!, Beth Nahrain has recently been granted more autonomy by their Mongol-descended overlords - but even this may not be enough to keep them from revolting.\n\nJust outside of the Near East, there are numerous hostile states which would love nothing more than to move into the region and seize the wealth - and prestige - associated with it. In Arabia, Muslim tribes remain, and have been biding their time, waiting for the perfect time to strike. To the northwest, of course, is §YByzantium§!, weakened but ferocious, ready to rise again from the ashes of its former self. And, of course, to the east, the newly-establish §YAfsharid§! dynasty of §YPersia§! looks west, and may very well wish to light the fires in Mahuza - or §YCtesiphon§! - once more."
 string_start_tag_far_east:1 "In [GetYear] conflict is brewing, as the §YYuan§! emperor's grip on power continues to slip, and many expect the mighty §YMing§! will soon make their move. It has to be seen, if §YJin§! will help defend it's overlord, or take a chance themselves. As long §YYekhe Khagan Adai Kublaid§! lives, he will keep them at bay, but many whisper, that he is ill, and his death will be the rallying call of the Han to shake the Mongol yoke. The armies of China will march again.\n\nTo the east, §YKorea§! prospers under the leadership of the now quite old king §YSejong§! and in §YJapan§!, the authority of the Shogunate has slowly begun to erode, in the wake of the assassination of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori."
 #string_start_tag_india:1 "In the period between §YTimur§!'s sack of §YDelhi§! in 1398, and the eventual §YMughal§! hegemony in the north, a number of strong and diverse regional kingdoms arose in India.\nSouthern India is locked in conflict between the §YBahmani§! Sultanate, the §YGajapati§! state in §YOrissa§!, and the §YVijayanagara§! Empire. In the north, the last of the Sayyid Sultans of Delhi is desperately trying to cling on to his throne, as a local magnate named §YBahlul Lodi§! marches on the capital. Meanwhile the former Delhian governors in §YJaunpur§!, §YGujarat§!, §YMalwa§!, and §YBengal§! fight each other and other local dynasties over the remains of the Delhian empire."
 string_start_tag_central_asia:1 "With §YPersian§! control over Khwarasan and the southern steppes a distant memory, and even the Ilkhan rule long gone, the princes of Sogdia are in constant squabble, over borders, raids, and especially religion. The Turkmeni tribes of §YKhiva§! are still waiting on their change to avenge the premature death of their great leader Timur, while the monastic lords of §YSamarkand§! and the Shahs of §YBaktria§! struggle to keep their independence from the encroaching remnants of the §YChagatayids§! hell bent to regain their empire.\nTo their north, the §YBlue Horde§! has so far avoided the further splintering of the eastern Golden Horde territories, and will seek to inherit the western §YWhite Horde§!.\n\nAs always Central Asia is a meeting point of ideas, religions and empires, and no one can foresee their future with certainty."
 string_start_tag_east_africa:1 "In the Eastern coast of Africa, widely known as the Kingozi Coast, as that is the lingua franca in the region, the Kingdom of §YKilwa§! is experiencing a Golden Age, as its wealthy capital shows to the foreign merchants that come from all over the Indian Ocean and the inner lands. In the mainland, in stark contrast, the former great power of Zimbabwe has been decaying for decades. New states are consolidating in the region, the most important being that of the Shona kings of §YMutapa§!, that is, ‘the Lords of the Land', that aim to reunite and reconstruct all the lands formerly held by the kings of Zimbabwe, making it Great again."
 string_start_tag_north_west_africa:1 "[GetYear] is a time of transition in North Africa. South of the Tinariwen, the old §YMali§! Empire is long past its prime, and by now most areas except the core of the state has slipped into independence or into the hands of the rising §YSonghai§! and §YMossi§! kingdoms, and the role Tadmunism will play in this region is yet to be seen.\n\nNorth of the Tinariwen, the Barbarie countries are slowly recovering from the aftermath of the crusades, but a clear dominant power has yet to rise. The Crusene crusader states like §YCarthago§!, §YTripolitania§! and §YAgadir§! are powers to be counted with, but in the mountains and deserts, a number of Catholic Berber kingdoms and Tadmunite chiefs wait for a moment of weakness, while in the West, in §YMauretania§!, religious tensions will surely soon boil over, no matter the soft stance past kings have take on the matter of religion."
 string_start_tag_horn_of_africa:1 "§YEthiopia§!, under the §YSolominid§! king §YYohannes§!, is experiencing a golden age of expansion and inner strength, and threatens the dominance of the ancient §YAxumite§! kingdom, which is in many ways still dominating the entire region, but was severely weakened by the loss of §YEthiopia§! and their own ambitions in Arabia.\n\nMeanwhile, the many smaller Pagan, Miaphysite and even Jewish states of the Horn of Africa, all view this struggle between this two great Cushitic kingdoms as an opportunity for their own expansion. Especially the Somalis are perfectly suited to build a great trade empire, if they can dominate the Kingozi lords in the south, and keep the Muslim Omani traders from further intrusions on their soil.\n\nFurther down the Nile, the small Christian Nubian Kingdoms are fighting both amongst themselves, as well as against falling in either the §YEgyptian§!, §YAxumite§! or §YEthiopian§! sphere of influence."
 #string_start_tag_south_india:1 "Separated from Northern India by the Vindhya mountains and the hills and jungles of Gondwana and the Garjats, southern India is in many ways its own separate mega-region, often simply called 'Deccan' or 'the South'. It broke free of the §YDelhi§! Sultanate's clutches long before the §YTimurid§! sack of Delhi in 1398.\n\nIn §YOrissa§! Kapilendra Gajapati, 'Lord of the Elephants', has turned his regional kingdom into a major power. Drawing upon the loyalty of the Garjat jungle kingdoms and the devotees of Jagannath, he has assembled a great army that performs especially well in the jungles and hills of Eastern India. In short succession Kapilendra has won a number of great victories, each seemingly more unlikely than the next. Having defeated Jaunpur, Bengal, the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar in various regional conflicts, he is now greedily eyeing Telingana and the Andhran coastline. With 18 legitimate sons, Kapilendra must act prudently to avoid all his great conquests being lost upon his death.\n\nIn the central Deccani upland the §YBahmani§! Sultanate has been free of Delhi's overlordship for almost 100 years. The Sultans are rich beyond the wildest dreams of the people in their old homelands in Iran, Transoxiana and Arabia, yet they are also the masters of a state far from the entrenched Muslim aristocrats of northern India. Cut off from the north, the state has become dependent on immigration from the Muslim west as well as the acquisition of foreign war horses from overseas. The recent loss of the western coastline is, therefore, a catastrophe for the Sultanate, and steps have been taken to expand to the eastern coast instead, interfering in the internal politics of the Velamas of §YTelingana§! as well as the Reddys of §YAndhra§!.\n\nJust a short distance from the Bahmani capital in §YBidar§! lies §YVijayanagar§!, the 'City of Victory' and the capital of their main adversary. From their base near the Tungabhadra river, the Sangama Rajas have built a military base in the dry Deccani upland that they then used to conquer the entire Tamil country to the south. The Tamil lands are incredibly rich, and could likely fund the growing Viyanagara empire for decades, yet integration has not been easy. The rich Tamil trade guilds retain a lot of power and they are also an excellent base for usurpers.\n\nThe south is also home to a number of smaller states, anxiously watching the titanic struggle between Vijayanagar, the Bahmanis and the surging Orissa Kingdom. They bide their time and ensure that the spice continues to flow. For such trade states like §YKochin§!, §YCalicut§!, §YCannanore§! and §YVenad§! or the Sinhalese kingdoms this has been their livelihood for centuries. Others, like the chiefs of §YMysore§! or the last §YPandyas§! in Tirunelvelli can only hope that their martial abilities will mean that once an opportunity arises they can actually seize it, for nothing is forever, and perhaps even the great cities of old could fall..."
 #string_start_tag_north_india:1 "Northern India reels in the wake of the collapse of the §YDelhi§! Sultanate and the recent §YTimurid§! invasion. Once spanning the entire region, the new §YSayyid§! Sultans of Delhi control an empire that is barely a shadow of its former glory. All founded by former generals under the defeated §YTughluq§! dynasty, the Sultans of §YBengal§! and §YJaunpur§! have declared their independence while the §YLodi§! governors of §YSirhind§! plan to seize the throne of Delhi for themselves. These rising powers will be integral to the unfolding history of the region, though they are not the only nations worthy of note.\n\nThe §YSamma§! dynasty of §YSindh§! have ruled from §YThatta§! for generations, having endured centuries of subjugation by the Delhi Sultanate. To their north, the Baluchi §YLanga§! tribe have seized an opportunity in the chaos of Delhi's collapse to conquer §YMultan§!. These nations enjoy a period of relative peace, though only Allah knows how long it will last.\n\nDynasties across India proudly trace their ancestry to §YRajputana§!, the unconquerable heartland of the §YRajput§!. §YMewar§! is nominally the largest and most powerful of the Rajput kingdoms, though they presently face a crisis as the §YRathore§! dynasty, discontent with the previous power-sharing arrangement, rises up in rebellion seeking to rule an independent §YMarwar§!. These events are watched closely by Mewar's greatest rivals, the §YKhalji§! Sultans of §YMalwa§!. Overlords of several Gondi and Vindhyan kingdoms, the Sultans are ever eager to expand their court with new subjects.\n\nHome to India's most prosperous ports, the mercantile Sultanate §YGujarat§! reaps the economic benefits of being a global center of trade. What it lacks however is a notable military force to deter its jealous Rajput, Bahmani, and Vijayanagari neighbours. To this end, Sultan Muhammad Shah II seeks to conquer the nearby Hindu princes and build a realm capable of resisting any would-be invaders. Capitalizing on trade must also be a high priority for Gujarat, as gold can be as effective as land ownership when raising an army.\n\n§YNepal§! is plagued with disunity, with each generation leading to the creation of new petty kingdoms as the sons of kings inherit or carve out their own realms. The §YMalla§! Kings of Kathmandu, the rising §YGorkha§! Kingdom, and the §YLimbuwan§! tribes all covet control over the Kathmandu Valley. Nepal must also contend with the question of religion as Tibetan monks begin to settle and spread the Buddhist faith. The dream of a unified Nepal lives on, though there is not yet any clear candidate for its fulfilment.\n\nThe §YAhom§! Kingdom is on the rise in §YAssam§!. Founded in the 13th Century as a Shan Mong, it has become a cultural melting pot with a sophisticated method of government utilizing the Paik system of labour and administration.\n\nAs the endless cycle of the rise and fall of empires continues, all that is certain of the future is that war is coming to India."

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, with its survival at stake. \n\nHowever, there's a chance for its rulers to recover the lost greatness, if they manage carefully their sparse resources, and re-establish their authority again upon their neighbours.

However, they remain divided in different kingdoms, with their own interests usually at odds.

After their rebellion against the centralized state of the Aksumites, the political system has traditionally been moving around different centers of power all around the Ethiopian highlands, sitting for only one or two reigns in a fixed place, and regional lords held a great share of military and economic power. One of the actions that may be taken by an Ethiopian ruler would be to promote the new §YKawa§! troops, as pacifiers in the realm.\n\nThat would also come at hand in military expansion, as many states view the rising §YEthiopian§!

 #string_start_bengal:1 "The §YBengal§! Sultanate won its independence from the §YTughluq§! dynasty of §YDelhi§! in a long struggle of diplomacy, siegecraft, and warfare that lasted from 1354-1359. Bengal has established itself as a unified and powerful Sultanate over the last century.\n\nThe Sultanate's original §YIlyas Shahi§! dynasty been restored by Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud, a capable administrator and a man committed to upholding peace and stability. He has thus far presided over the development of Bengal's cities and the construction of magnificent new mosques.\n\nThe most pressing foreign threats facing Bengal are the §YGajapati§! Kingdom of §YOrissa§! and the §YSharqi§! dynasty of §YJaunpur§!. The Gajapatis command the loyalty of the Garjat tribes, as they traditionally pledge their loyalty to whichever power controls the major coastal cities. If Bengal can defeat the Orissa kingdom, they might be convinced to extend that same loyalty to the Sultan. Like Bengal itself, the Jaunpur Sultanate broke free from the grip of Delhi, though it has enjoyed its independence only since 1393. Jaunpur controls a vast stretch of the Doab, the great riverine lands of the Ganges. Bengal and Jaunpur came to blows as recently as 1420. Though the conflict came to an abrupt end due to the intervention of Timurid and Ming envoys, many sore issues remain between both nations and further wars may be inevitable.\n\nRelations with the Buddhist Sultans of §YArakan§! have fluctuated wildly; in one year they are the Bengal’s loyal subjects, in another they are ambivalent allies, and in yet another they are a pirate menace. Future relations with Arakan are likely to be guided just as much by circumstance.\n\nBengal is a promising regional hegemon, with great potential for expansion.

 #string_start_delhi:1 "Founded by the Turkic §YMamluk§! dynasty in 1206, the §YDelhi§! Sultanate began as a regional power in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Under the §YTughlaq§! dynasty it grew into the largest Indian empire the world had seen since the Guptas. The empire spanned from §YSindh§! to §YBengal§!, from §YKashmir§! to the §YCoromandel Coast§!.\n\nThe Tughlaq empire collapsed as quickly as it rose to power. Though it is a Muslim state ruling over many millions of Hindus, its downfall was orchestrated by ambitious Muslim generals rather than popular Hindu resistance. In 1347 the entirety of southern §YIndia§! was lost in the revolt of general Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, who declared himself ruler of the new Sultanate of §YBahmanis§!.\n\nMore recently, the Sultanate suffered a catastrophic blow when the §YSharqi§! governors of §YJaunpur§! broke away in 1394, taking with them a vast stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and reducing the Sultanate's influence to an area barely beyond the city walls. Mahmud Shah, Sultan of Jaunpur, eyes his neighbors hungrily; he has designs not only on the throne of Delhi, but also on the nearby Bengal Sultanate and the §YGajapati§! Kingdom of §YOrissa§!. The Sultan's ambitions threaten to engulf all of northern India.\n\nThe final nail in the Tughlaq's coffin came with the brutal §YTimurid§! invasion in 1398. The fearsome warlord had no intention of beginning a conquest of India, instead setting his armies to loot and burn and massacre all that they laid eyes upon. In the midst of the chaos, the Tughlaq dynasty was finally overthrown by the §YSayyid§! governors of Delhi. The upstart Sayyids have thus far entirely failed to put an end to the catastrophe facing the Sultanate. Only the Rajputs of §YJangladesh§! remain truly loyal to the Sultan in this period of ruin.\n\nJust as the Sayyids rose from governors to Sultans, another powerful governor has risen in §YSirhind§!. Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan noble, is an extremely adept governor and military leader. His control of the §YPunjab§! gives him a dangerous degree of power, which he is likely to leverage in a bid to seize control of Delhi itself. The Sayyid Sultan hides in his palace as Lodi gathers his strength in preparation for a rebellion.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate is in the midst of collapse. Many covet the throne, but will a new conqueror rise to restore the Sultanate, or shall it be consigned to history as as symbol of doomed ambition?"

The country lost the grip on its former tributaries, and a civil war ensued. Finally, during the early 15th century, Nestorian Christianity, which had slowly been spreading in the region for centuries, began to enter the courts and highest echelons of many states in the region, and their staunch adherence to Hinduism, effectively undermining the political position of §YMajapahit§!, and this allowed the Christian influence to spread even faster among the former Hindu people.\n\nNow the country is at a crossroads.

Along with the neighboring city-state of §YMaynila§!, it has established a monopoly on the trade with China through their contact with the Cantonese kingdom, effectively being middlemen of the Chinese goods with all the Philippines archipelago. Its dominant position makes them wealthy, and they are very well situated to maybe start a unification of Luzon and the neighboring islands for the first time in their history."

In the end the kingdom of Dai Viet was officially dissolved, and replaced by a Cantonese vassal-state now called §YAnnam§! meaning 'Pacified South' in Chinese.\n\nDespite this, the §YCantonese§! grip on the country is still very weak, as there is infighting among pro- and anti-Cantonese court and noble factions, as well as growing resistance in the hills and jungles.

And if the Solomonid empire across the Red Sea can overcome it's slow decline, reclaiming their lost influence in Yemen and linking up with the Yemeni Christians will surely be their first goal.\n\nIn the overwhelmingly Alawite highlands, the once powerful §YAlids§! are now restricted to this single piece of land in Arabia where their are rule was never disputed by sectarian politics, and maybe they can claw themselves back to power, if only they could settle their own succession struggles.\n\nTo the east, there lies the only free Jewish state in the whole world, with the §YKindah§! tribal federation. This bands of bandits and pirates have long converted the riches of Yemen proper, and especially the ancient city of Marib, they regard as sacred, and may try their luck someday in the future.\n\nBut the true treat, may come from even further east, for there is a new contender for Yemen, with the port city of §YAden§! now acting as an extension of the mighty §YOmani§! trade empire. The Omanis long to dominate all trade in the Red Sea, and will not tolerate any threat to their assets. Once Aden is firmly under their control, the Omanis may well be the ones to settle the Yemenite infighting. They have a special dislike against both the §YAlids§!, which oppressed them in the past, and the §YKindah§!which constantly harass their taderoutes, and aside from Aden, they long to secure the valuable Yemeni ports of Mukha, and Zabid, and for all those reasons would not hesitate to intervene."

This way Alexander secured the §YBagrationi§! dynasty's standing, but in practice this means, that he made a Georgian rebirth even more difficult.\n\nAs the §YByzantines§! face another civil war, and the §YQara Qoyunlu§! are threatened by the rising Power of Persia, the §YGeorgians§! face a struggle for their survival, like never before."

 string_start_qara_qoyunlu:1 "The origin of the §YQara Qoyunlu§!, or the Black Sheep, is somewhat unclear, though their own tradition has them as descendants of the great Oghuz Khans of the past. For over a century now the Black Sheep have been trying to carve out an Empire for themselves in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Set up as a tributary of the mighty Ilkanate, they still nominally pay tribute to the §YJalayirids§!, which are all that is left of that mighty Mongol Khanate, but this has become a lip service only in the last century, and an ambitious ruler, could become tempted to abuse their weakness for their own gain.\n\nWith the Ilkanate crumbling and many Persian warlords trying to fill the void, the Qara Qoyunlu could rise to their greatest power yet, and under §YJahân Shâh§!, one of the greatest rulers of the age, have taken not only a nearly all of Western Armenia, and successfully suppressed another Armenian uprising, but managed to inherit all the old Mongol vassals in Georgia and Eastern Armenia.\n\nTo the west, they managed to take the abandoned territories of the other Turkic tribal federation of the §YAq Qoyunlu§!, or White Sheep, which had left Anatolia to fight for the Ilkhans against Egypt, and have now successfully invaded the Nile Delta, which makes it unlikely, that they will claim their old homelands again.

From east to west the oppressed Nestorian communities are ready to rise up, and engage the Zoroastrian administration in full rebellion. Indeed, the news of their christian brothers being oppressed more and more are worrying for the Qara Qoyunlu, but could also spell and opportunity.\n\nAlso, along the South-Western border, the infighting between the Kurdish domains - heirs to the once mighty Eyubid empire - is growing worse, and their defenses weaker. In their thirst for glory the Eyubid rulers seem oblivious to the threat posed by Jahân Shâh and the Black Sheep..."

When he §YIlkanate§! gave them the opportunity to seek new glory and riches in far away lands, they did not waver, and left their home in Anatolia to go fight the Egyptians for them, in the Syrian frontier.\n\nFollowing the downfall of the Ilkanate, the tribes stayed in the region, and slowly but surely moved south into Palestine, and finally achieved what the Ilkanate with all it's great armies could not - conquer Egypt! Or at least the Nile delta.\n\nTheir victory was swift and crushing for the Egyptians, but they have to be careful. The Pharao managed against all odds, to relief the siege of Memphis and halted the turkic advance, and, even now, he mustering troops for a counter attack, to take back the coast, and - most importantly - the great city of Alexandria.\n\nIf the Aq Qoyunlu can defeat him, conquer Memphis, and break the Pharaos power once and for all, they could truly take all of Egypt and become a great power. Their opportunities for expansion would know no bounds."

 #Tatars
 string_start_tatars:1 "The §YGolden Horde§! is dead; its §YTatar§! successors fight over its corpse even as their enemies grow strong around them. The once great empire of §YJochi§!, son of §YGenghis Khan§!, has been divided into several Khanates each seeking dominance over the steppe.\n\nThe most direct successors to the Golden Horde are the §YWhite Horde§! in the West, and the §YBlue Horde§! in the East. Still controlling the city of Saratov, as well as Crimea, Khagan Küchük pronounces his hegemony over the steppe to deaf ears, while his enemies plot rebellion around the sea of Azov. The constituent tribes continue to break from his rule and the Khagan has thus far been unable to stop them, while his enemies in the §YBlue Horde§! plot for a push westward.\n\nA Khagan who is not feared even by his neighbors is barely a Khagan at all; once mere tax-collectors, the Grand Principality of §YMuscovy§! has expanded greatly without a strong Khagan to keep them in check. If they are left to grow they will surely seek to throw off the Tatar yoke entirely and conquer the steppes for themselves. Likewise, the §YRuthenians§! have shaken all Tatar control, and set up their own small kingdoms and principalities. Especially the reborn principality of §YKiew§! and the Baltic kingdom of §YLithuania§! will try to unite all of Ruthenia and likely continue to pose a threat to the nomads.\n\nSouth of the Ural, the once mighty Bolghars and the lesser Khanate of the Bashkirs struggle to keep their newly won freedom against the double onslaught of Tatars and Rus, and without a miracle will surely be utterly crushed and once again integrated into a lager empire, forcing it's will on their people. If they could only conquer the city of Kazan, most important trade hub in the region, their Khanate would gain easy access to nearby veins of metals both precious and utilitarian. This would give them a fighting chance against the greedy invaders.\n\nIn 1444, the §YCrimean Khanate§! still part of the White Horde, but only barely. The current climate of instability in the White Horde has finally reached its breaking point with the return of Rafaal Giray, Crimean descendant of Jochi, once exiled by Calaletdin - former Khagan of the White Horde, who's prodigal son was himself exiled to the Blue Horde - and claims to be a worthier heir for the Golden Throne. This could very well sign the beginning of the end White Horde.\n\nThe §YNogai§! and §YBlue Horde§! Khanates, while successful in their bid for independence and controlling vast stretches of the steppe, lack the wealth or strategic importance of the other successor states. Opportunism must be their guiding philosophy if they wish to claim any part of Genghis Khan’s legacy, and by great fortune it seems that their southern neighbors in Persia are ripe for another religious Civil War, and with this ripe for conquest from the Steppes. A worthy Khan might take the chance to seize the cities of §YSamarkand§! or §YTashkent§! and secure one of the most valuable stretches the silk road, before the Persians, Kartids or Eastern Mongols do so."

In an effort to recover from the tragedy of the Black Death, Genoa emulated the Venetian model of republican government where the Doge would hold the highest title in the government and claim sovereignty over the entire Republic. \n\nMeanwhile, Genoa would find itself in endless conflict with the Venetians, contesting hold over the Greek archipelago and the Black Sea. As conflicts with Venice began to subside, Genoa launched a crusade alongside §YFrance§! against the Barbary corsairs in §YTunis§!. While the siege of §YMahdia§! was not successful, both sides negotiated a peace treaty that would drastically reduced the piracy issue from the North Africans. \n\nIn 1444, Genoa has already lost several conflicts with France and §YMilan§!, and the island of §YSardinia§! has long since been lost to the Crown of §YAragon§!. Genoa finds itself in a precarious position; to the east, Venice is still a competitor and the leader of the rival trade league, contesting Genoese influence in Anatolia. The Ottomans have made it clear they wish to consolidate Anatolia and the Black Sea, seizing any opportunities they have to wrestle the Genoese out of the region. Meanwhile, other Italian republics and city-states continue to struggle with the dominance in Italy. Milan to the east and France and Aragon to the west pose the greatest threat to the survival of Genoa, and it will take a delicate hand on the pen and the sword to navigate this complex web of alliances and claims and guide Genoa into a prosperous future."
 string_start_byzantium:3 "Even many centuries after the fall of the §YRoman Empire§! in the West, the Eastern half of the empire, the §YByzantines§!, still remain strong. After the destruction of the Caliphate at Yarmouk and the reconquest of Italy by Justinian, the §YByzantines§! seemed to be on the path of restoring the whole Roman Empire, but after the Plague of Justinian arrived and Egypt and Armenia revolted, Byzantium once again entered a path of decline.\n\nStill, though the Empire more than once faced what seemed like certain destruction, it always persevered. Be it the Seljuks, Mongols, Bulgars or Germans, none of the could topple the true successor of Rome.\n\nHowever, it was never outside forces that posed the greatest threat to §YByzantium§!, but rather the backroom dealings and intrigue of the Imperial subjects of Constantinople. In true Roman tradition, the Empire was repeatedly ripped apart by civil conflict and the infighting between the great Greek and Anatolian houses vying for power - often aiming at the throne. The chaos created by these constant power struggles has not only cost the Empire valuable provinces, like Illyria - which is now a battlefield between the Basileus and German kings in Prague - or Cappadocia, which fell in hands of the powerful Doukid dynasty - but also their hold over former vassals like the Turkic §YCumans§! in Moesia, the §YGrikos§! in Southern Italy and even §YArberia§!. Their hold over eastern Anatolia is virtually non-existent, and even the Turks of §YEretna§! dream of reclaiming their old §YRûmi§! legacy.\n\nIn 1444, Byzantium finds itself in an unstable peace between the great Imperial houses of the §YKomnenoi§!, §YPalaiologoi§! and §YAngeloi§!, as no one dares to make a premature move for as long as §YIoannes VIII Komnenos§! or his son §YKonstantinos Andronikos§! are alive, but with Ioannes rapidly approaching fifty, and Konstantinos having suffered from ill health for most of his life, it is only a question of time before Byzantium faces its biggest dynastic crisis yet. Powers in both the East and West believe that the age of §YByzantium§! is long since over, but one thing the houses agree on, is that §YConstantinople§! is to rise once again and reclaim not just §YAnatolia§! or the §YBalkans§!, but the §YRoman Empire§! itself!"
 #string_start_venice:1 "The Republic of §YVenice§! began as a humble village on an island on the edge of a lagoon, but in the Middle Ages it grew to become one of the preeminent powers of the Mediterranean.

Across the Italian Peninsula, the Republic of §YGenoa§! envies Venice's control of Mediterranean trade, and would enjoy nothing more than to see Venice's vast maritime empire collapse and for it to pick up the pieces. In the eastern Mediterranean, meanwhile, the §YOttomans§! are expanding in every direction. Turkish territories already border Venetian holdings in several regions, and it is surely just a matter of time before the Sultan orders an invasion. To the north, the Habsburgs of §YAustria§!, lords of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, look at Venice's mainland Italian holdings as an affront to Imperial rule. To the south, the §YPapal State§! yearns to recover territories the Venetians seized from it as recently as 1440 and loathes the autonomy of Venice's clergymen. The Republic must remain vigilant and use all the diplomatic tools at its disposal to prevent its rivals from working together, lest Venice's fate lay in the balance.\n\nVenice's internal security is also carefully watched by the authorities. Although Venice is a §Yrepublic§!, its system of government is a very peculiar one, designed to both shut out the mob and to prevent any one patrician family from seizing control of government, as has happened in some mainland communes. Through an elaborate series of secret ballots and votes held by different circles of electors, the §YVenetian Government§! does much to preserve the republic's unique traditions."

If the Papacy does nothing to curb these cities' autonomy, they could slip out of Rome's grasp entirely.\n\nHis Holiness has far greater challenges ahead of him than upstart leaders of Italian communes, however. As the head of the §YCatholic§! faith, the Pope has a unique responsibility to protect the faith and spread the Word of God far beyond the confines of the Papal States' worldly borders. To the east across the Adriatic Sea, the §YOttomans§! threaten the Christian bastions of the Balkans, and left unchecked could march into the heart of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! itself. Far to the north, the venerable monastic states of the §YTeutonic Order§! and §YLivonian Order§!, tasked by the Church with serving as Christendom's bulwarks in the Baltic, are being torn apart by envious princes, and left unsupported could be extinguished entirely. Most worrying of all, dark murmurs are beginning to spread, speaking ill not just of the Pope, but of the entire structure of the Catholic Church! These muttered calls for some sort of §YReformation§!, left unchecked, could spell disaster for the Papacy.\n\nAll the diplomatic skills of the Pope should not be used purely in reaction to events, of course. With all the power and prestige of the Church supporting him, His Holiness could construct a great §YHoly League§! to tackle the Ottoman menace. New crusades can be called, and if they succeed then Christianity can at last be restored in Jerusalem. As explorers chart the unknown corners of the globe, missionaries can follow, spreading the faith to such far-flung regions as §YChina§! and §YJapan§!.

Provencal land in the Rhineland is split between the directly ruled Duchy of Bar and the subject Duchy of §YLorraine§!. Provence risks the ire of both the Holy Roman Emperor and the powerful Duchy of §YBurgundy§! if it chooses to meddle in affairs of the Rhineland Princes. The Duchy of Provence itself lies on the north coast of the Mediterranean, nested between France, §YSavoy§!, and the §YPapal§! city of Avignon. From here the ambitious René may launch an invasion of Aragon, though Italy may be a more tempting prize as the Empire's hold over the region wanes.\n\nProvence maintains good relations with its largest and most powerful neighbor, France. Provence must balance its own defensive needs and plans for expansion with French expectations of support should the Hundred Years war once again break out into open war.\n\nProvence is a nation with great ambitions, but even staving off annihilation may prove to be a challenge as surrounding nations eye its' lands greedily."

While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest.

More importantly their princes have often acted as collectors for the Khans of the Golden Hordes.

The Western tribes of the §YWhite Horde§! is still a strong power in its own right, but it too is fraught by internal struggles and has been unable to project much power over the Russians.\n\nMuscovy has made good use of this power vacuum, expanding their control over the other principalities rapidly, through cunning, the use of military resources and strategic marriage politics. Often even by simply buying out the poorer Princes and adding their lands to the Muscovite domain.\n\nMoscow is not the only strong state with interest in the Russian region, however, in the north the Republic of §YNovgorod§! has colonized much of the White Sea coastline, securing the valuable waterways and a source of fur, the soft gold of the north and east.\n\nTo the west the Grand Duchy of §YLithuania§! and the Principality of §YKiew§! are doing what they can to assume the leadership of all Russias, asserting authority over some of the Ruthenian lands as well as a constant factor in the politics of the free Russian states in the north and east.

To our North are the English who wish to add the French Crown to their collection, and to our East is the rebellious House de Bourgogne who would dare to claim the throne for themselves. Before the French can even begin thinking about expanding their Empire, they must first ensure the loyalty of their subjects and integrate them into a centralized state, and remove the cursed English and Burgundian pretender Kingdoms from their border.

By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time.

'§YLund§! for the Pope, §YSjælland§! for the merchants coffers, §YJutland§! for the traitors and §YSchleswig§! as a nobles' toy.' is a common saying amongst the Danish peasantry, who long for the day, Denmark is once again united and free from Norwegian and Swedish oppression.\nHowever, the Act of the §YNordic Union§!, the soon to be finalisation of the Union of §YSweden§! and §YNorway§!, will likely ensure, that Denmark will truly be no more. The clock is ticking, and this might be the last real chance to restore Danish independence!"
 string_start_sweden:1 "Sine the late 13th century, the Kingdom of §YSweden§! has been in a de-facto union with the kingdom of §YNorway§!, as both nations were ruled by branches of the §YBjälboätten§! dynasty. The union however was rather loose, and in many ways proved to be a disappointment to the Swedish nobles. Unable or even unwilling to coordinate, the jointly occupied §YDenmark§!, known as the §YDansk Fristaten§!, have become more and more unruly, which dragged our nations in many conflicts with §YLübeck§! and the Hanseatic cities, which have been quite costly. Many of our nobles are weary of their hard-earned money being spent on Danish League adventures in Northern Germany, wars that also disrupt trade and hinder the export of Swedish iron.\n\nTensions reached an all time high during the 'Brotherly War' of 1388, in which the Norwegian branch of the Bjälboätten tried to forcibly take over Sweden. The conflict resulted in a draw, and compromise, that resulted in the current situation, of the king of Sweden, and queen of Norway, ruling their realms jointly, with their son §YErik Lukasson§! designated heir to both nations, to finally make the Nordic Union official.\n\nA new king of a united Sweden-Norway, would be able to finally subdue the Dansk Fristaten, deal with our enemies in Novgorod and the Baltics, and crush the Sami tribes up north.\n\nBut it is not clear, if Sweden would accept a ruler, that may would favour Norway. Time will make it clear if the Nordic Union can prevail, or if Sweden will walk its own way. What is clear is that the control over the Baltic Sea and its many estuaries and ports will be imperative to the Swedish Kingdom. The sea routes are what binds the large Swedish kingdom together, from Kalmar to Viborg, and that is also how the bountiful Swedish iron and copper reach the continent.\n\nFor Sweden to achieve such dominion over the Baltics, a Dominium Maris Baltici, it will have to defeat not only German merchants but also get involved in the politics of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Not to mention overcoming the §YTeutonic§! and §YLivonian§! Orders and others who are interested in controlling the Baltic trade. The §YRussian§! Principalities, the §YPolish§! and the §YLithuanians§! are all long term natural rivals in this struggle, not to mention the Norwegian kingdom with which Sweden is currently united..."
 string_start_norway:1 "Sine the late 13th century, the Kingdom of §YNorway§! has been in a de-facto union with the kingdom of §YSweden§!, as both nations were ruled by branches of the §YBjälboätten§! dynasty. Although a Norwegian Council of State of queen Kristina formally governs the country, since the black plague, the influence of Danish nobles from occupied Jutland has been increasing in our nation, making the Danish Nobility increasingly privileged.\n\nBut also Norwegian landed nobles and merchants prospered under this system, as they were effectively the middlemen between the Crown and the commoners, thus the country was ruled by the privileged Nobles instead of the Royal Court. However, this system is maybe not the most favourable for the country, as the conflicts related to the Danish League, fought together with Sweden, has been draining Norwegian resources.\n\nSince the heir to both the throne of Sweden and Norway, §YErik Lukasson§!, has been educated with his mother in Norway, there is a good chance, that a Nordic Union will in future be in fact a Norway-Sweden, rather then the other way around, so opportunities to choose the fate of Norway may arise, and there are some voices claiming to address the §YCall of our Forefathers§!, encouraging the Norwegian §YNatural Seamanship§!."
 string_start_gotland:1 "§YGotland§! is an island in the middle of the Baltic Sea, which grew prosperous thanks to the port of Visby, a commercial center for the region. Its commercial laws set a standard for most of the Baltic ports and ships, and its famous walls protected the city from its enemies.\n\nOriginnally part of the crown of Sweden, during the 'Brotherly War' of 1388, the only real conflict between Norway and Sweden after the 'Danish Wars of Succession', the German Pirates of the Vitalian Brethren in the service of Mecklenburg, then allied to Norway, took over Gotland, ruling it as an unsinkable pirate ship. The Hansa soon saw their chance, and with a simple stroke of a pen, pirates became merchants, and Gotland ally of the Hansa. Since then Sweden was never able to retake Gotland.\n\nVital in helping the Hansa crush the Nordic Union and Danish League navy in Sound War, the merchant council has gathered great influence within the Hansa, so much so, that it has developed serious ambitions, to one day maybe even challenge Lubeck. They certainly seek to extend their reach into the Balic, encroaching on Polish and Teutonic claims, and are ready to pounce, should the Danish League ever be unprotected. But the nations around the Baltic will not sit idly by, and let them prepare. The goal of the council has to be to strengthen their §YNavy§! and refocusing the country back on commercial activities. Only time will tell, if we will see the rise of a §YGnutish§! merchant federation, or it's eventual demise in a world of new great powers."

But due to various setbacks, the §YTeutonic Order§! lost control of many of it's holdings in southern Prussia, giving the Pruthenian tribes to rebuild and replenish, marking the beginning of its decline as an independent political entity. That they were not yet able to wipe out the cursed heathens has been of great shame to the Order.\n\nNew paths may be open for the ruler of the country, but getting out from this situation and reforging the old Crusader spirit will require determination and ability. But other, different opportunities could be seized in the coming decades, who knows..."

Despite its early successes, the Brotherhood suffered a heavy defeat against the Lithuanians. The remaining members of the Brotherhood were later incorporated into the §YTeutonic Order§!, which later branched off into the §YLivonian Order§!, retained authority over these lands in a similar way.\n\nHowever, their fate has been tied to that of their brothers in arms, as defeat after defeat against §YPoland§! and §YLithuania§! and their heathen allies has also weakened the §YLivonian Order§!. This has allowed the heathens of Estonia and Livonia to rise up, and drive the representatives of the §YLivonian Order§! and their vassals, out of their lands. The heathens once again rule large parts of Livonia.\n\nThis situation has led the Landmeister of the §YLivonian Order§! to make crucial decisions for the future of the Order and how it will be governed for the decades to come."

After Ottokar II. beat the §YHabsburg§! pretender at the §YBattle of the Marchfeld§! in 1278, both §YStyria§!, including Carinthia and Carniola, and §YAustria proper§! have been under continued §YPremysl§! rule. This has brought prosperity and stability to the region, and even put an end to the continues §YBulgar§! raids into eastern Austria.\n\nNot all is well though. There is significant rivalry between §YVienna§! and §YSteyr§!, and especially the loss of the second most important Styrian city of Graz, after a failed attempt to regain independence by the Styrian nobility, has soured relations between the Green March, it's overlord and their Austrian brothers. This has weakened the position of the Austrian nobility over all, and there are even rumors, that the whole affair was planed by Prague to keep Austria divided.\n\nWhile the East is divided and subdued, the West of Austria - the duchies of §YTirol§! and §YBregenz§! - still enjoy freedom under §YWittelsbach§! and §YMontfort-Bregenz§! rule respectively, and many would rather see them as lords of all Austria, than a Bohemian king, though their power is simply not yet great enough to compete with the emperor.\n\nBut there is still hope for a united Austria.

Thus far they have survived by playing the dangerous game of offering fealty to whichever nation they believe most likely to protect them against the others. A Voivode who wishes to thrive must carefully observe the balance of power.\n\nThe Voivodes had long been members of the Order of the Dragon, a noble and knightly order dedicated to defending Christendom from the encroaching §YTatar Hordes§!, constantly raiding into Europe, and though the §YCumans§!, a Tatar tribal federation just south of Dacia, claim to moved on from their ancestral practices, the Voivodes stay always weary of their neighbors movements.\n\nIn the last few centuries, to keep at least some independence, the principality of §YWallachia§! had to bow to §YBulgar§! rule, and while the current Voivode §Y[WAL.Monarch.GetName]§! is loyal to his Bulgarian overlords, his succession is highly disputed, and the mighty wallachian nobility would prefer an anti-Bulgar candidate to take the throne, restore independence and - their full powers.\n\nIn §YTransylvania§! conflict is brewing between the ruling orthodox Bulgar nobility, and the mostly catholic Dacian peasantry, with the Saxon merchant class and the semi-independent Magyar Szeklers firmly on the side of the §YBulgarians§!. Only through outside interference, it seems, can the Dacian peasantry of Transylvania hope to retain their unique catholic heritage, and many hope for the emperor in Prague to intervene on their behave.\n\nUncertainty grips Moldavia also; the current monarch §YStefan II§! has not only a strong claim to the §YWallachian§! throne, but also dangerous ambitions to elevate the status of his nation to a regional power, filling the void a failing §YBulgarian§! empire could leave behind.

 string_start_philippines:1 "In [GetYear] the Philippine islands are home to a number of small seafaring city states. The islands have always been distant enough to preserve their autonomy even in the face of strong hegemons like the former Srivijaya empire or the Nestorian kingdoms of §YBrunei§! and §YSamudera§! or the Buddhist kingdom of §YMalacca§!.\n\nInstead the archipelago has developed into a microcosm of indianized, sinophile and christianized kingdoms, each with their own character and background.\n\nIn the north, on the island of Luzon, the city states of §YPangasinan§! and §YTondo§! thrive on the trade with the §YEmpire of China§!. And though the have lost their status as tributaries following the Yuan defeat of the south, the old ties still allow them to gather Chinese goods for resale to the other islands. To this end the small city state of §YMaynila§!, has entered into close cooperation with Tondo. The latter acts as a port towards the Chinese while the former is the central point for the spreading of Chinese goods to the other islands.\n\nFurther south, in the Visayan archipelago, a number of Hindu settlements are competing to control the trade routes. The island kingdom of §YCebu§! is perhaps the oldest state in the region. The Cebu rulers claim the legacy of a prince of the Indian §YChola§! Empire. Many of the other states have entered into the federation of §YMadyas§!, a loose organization where each member takes turns to assume leadership over the others.\n\nWhile the old Hindu Rajahnate of §YButuan§! has traditionally held the upper hand in the far south it has recently had increasing competition from the Christian oriented states of §YMaguindanao§! and §YSulu§!. Sulu has all but entered the sphere of the Christian kingdom of Brunei while Maguindanao has seen the royal family increasingly embracing christian traditions over their traditional animist religion.\n\nSome would say that the divided nature of this rich archipelago at the turn of [GetYear] makes it vulnerable. Only time will tell if the Philippine microcosm can survive the arrival of new faiths, peoples and weapons."

Solely mighty §YYuan§! dynasty, the domain of §YKublai Khan§!, has managed to hold most of it's power in northern China, even though they had to give up their southern domains. But also in the North, resistance against the Yuan Emperorship is growing, the mighty §YMing§! are ready to seize power in the midst of a mass uprising against Mongol rule.\n\nToday the Mongol Khans cannot even claim to rule the steppe, as in the west, some parts of Mongolia have fallen under the sway of a new Mongol power: the §YOirat Confederation§! led by §YEsen Choros§!. Esen has great ambitions; refusing to pay tribute to the Yuan, he is willing to fight their vast armies in a bid for dominance. If Esen were not such a brilliant military commander the Western Mongols would be unlikely to accept such brash posturing.\n\nThe §YChagatai Khanate§! is the most unstable of the Mongol successor states, and merely a shadow of itself, and is not even referred to by that name anymore, as wars against the Tibetans and Yuan cost them most of their power.

The §YYuan§! wish to avoid another Jurchen uprising, and takes measures to ensure that they continue to fight among themselves with no faction becoming too powerful. To that end, the Yuan seek to established a loose overlordship over the §YJianzhou§! and §YHaixi§! Jurchens.\n\nOf the Jurchen tribes the Jianzhou are by far the most powerful. Like the Haixi they are a settled people; the institutions and philosophies of Chinese rule are slowly spreading into the region and being embraced by local Khans.\n\nDespite the encroachment of Chinese rule and customs, the settled Jurchens retain most of the same traditions and the warrior-culture of the ‘Wild Jurchens’ to the north. The nomadic tribes of §YYeren§!, §YUdege§!, and §YDonghai§! are far from powerless, and have to contend only with each other and the relatively isolated §YSolon§! and §YNikvh§! peoples.\n\n§YKorea§! often finds itself at odds with the Jurchens, and has only recently annexed the north-eastern provinces of §YYukjin§! and §YGyeongseong§! from a branch of the Jianzhou. Both the Jurchens and Koreans consider §YPaektu Mountain§! to be a sacred place, and each believe that they alone should have access to the holy peak.\n\nThe Jurchens and the §YMongols§! have an ever-changing relationship. Sometimes allies and sometimes bitter rivals, the tribes of both people often intermarry to secure political ties, and dynastic feuding is common. Though the Yuan emperor tries to keep these to a minimum these days.\n\nThe Jurchen Khans remember the days of Jin fondly. If they are able to overcome the divisions between the tribes and keep the Mongols at bay they may yet rise again under a new leader, defeat the Yuan, Ming, or anyone else who comes to rule China and forge for themselves a new identity."
 string_start_korea:2 "The §YJoseon Kingdom of Korea§!, officially the §YKingdom of Great Joseon§!, emerged from the ashes of §YMongol§! and §YYuan§! invasions via a coup d'état by General §YYi Seonggye§! (later known as §YKing Taejo§!) in 1392. From the start, Joseon Korea's connection to §YYuan§! was strong: When settling on a name for the new kingdom, Taejo submitted the options 'Hwaryeong' and 'Joseon' to Yuan and decided on the latter after its endorsement by the Great Khan.\n\nAs followers of §YConfucianism§!, Koreans viewed China as being at the heart of the Korean world, and Joseon Korea came to be in some ways even more sinicized than China itself - a 'little China'. For their part, the Chinese viewed Joseon Korea as the 'country of courteous people in the East'. For as long as Yuan remains the undisputed claimant to the §YMandate of Heaven§!, the maintenance of these strong bonds will remain vital to the survival of the fledgling Korean kingdom.\n\nThe achievements of the first century of §YJoseon§! rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the border regions of §YGyeongseong§! and §YYukjin§! were taken from the §YJurchens§!, allowing the Koreans to unite the territory which would form modern-day Korea. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the hangeul alphabet was introduced in 1446. Unlike the Chinese alphabet, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gunpowder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and record the geography of the land.\n\nHowever, threats to the Korean kingdom remain from both within and beyond its borders. At home, Korea's peasants remain poor, and both §Ypeasant uprisings§! and insufficient tax receipts are likely to become a problem if nothing is done to rectify the situation. Furthermore, although the upper class of §Yyangban elites§! has for the most part been united, the cracks in this façade are already beginning to show and could erupt into §Yfactional strife§! at any time.\n\nOn the foreign front lie threats aplenty. To the north await the warlike §YJurchens§! - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, an invasion of Korea might follow swiftly. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies §YJapan§!, a nation of warring §Ydaimyos§! and would-be §Yshoguns§!. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan seek to expand its power across the narrow channel of the Korean Sea.
