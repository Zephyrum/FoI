Rather, they seek to bring down the Empire for personal gain, whether for more autonomy or to take the jade throne for themselves. The §YRed Turban§! rebels, while no longer rising up, are still supporting the §YZhu§! family's bid for the throne, and their warlord state has grown far faster than the rest. With a strong militia or loyal and hardened soldiers backing them up, their shot is a very solid one.\n\nUp north, near the §YMongol§! homelands and the northern capital - now called §YKhanbaliq§! - the authority of the §YGreat Khan§! is still maintained. The sons of §YTemüjin Khan§! are not sitting idly as their work collapses. Reforms have been implemented, and rebellions suppressed. But court intrigue is also starting to wear it down, as the next in line for the throne is still a young child that the court eunuchs are often trying to undermine the legitimacy and authority of, while also sabotaging his education.\n\nEverything is paving the way for a long and drawn-out battle for the throne."
