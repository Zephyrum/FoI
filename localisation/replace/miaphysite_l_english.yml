 coptic:0 "Miaphysite"
 coptic_religion_desc:1 "Miaphysite Christianity is a branch of Christendom that believes in a single nature of Christ, both human and divine. Followers of Miaphysitism comprise the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Copts who answer to the Patriarch in Alexandria.\nWith the fall of Egypt to the Muslims hundreds of years ago the Patriarch is controlled by a non-Christian state with the Miaphysite religion surviving as the majority faith only in Ethiopia, Nubia and Africa."
 HINT_RELIGION_TEXT:0 "A major cause of division, other than cultural differences, are religious differences. A Catholic country, for example, will consider other countries that are Protestant, Reformed, Miaphysite or Orthodox as heretics, while it would consider other religions to be heathens. All the provinces in your country affect your Religious Unity. You can convert provinces to your religion with a Missionary."
 coptic_conquest_of_alexandria_desc:0 "The Patriarchate of Alexandria and of all Africa is the largest Miaphysite Church in the world but its ancient seat as well as a large part of the Miaphysite community currently languishes under foreign ruler. We must liberate Alexandria and reinvigorate the Egyptian Coptic Community!"
 coptic_conquest_of_yerevan_title:0 "Liberate the Armenians"
 coptic_conquest_of_yerevan_desc:0 "The Armenian mother see of Holy Etchmiadzin still stands strong but the Armenian Miaphysites have not had their own state since the fall of their Kingdoms in 1360 and 1375. Let us liberate the Armenian Miaphysites once and for all under our own banner!"
 the_faithful_liberated_desc:0 "The faithful Miaphysites of this province have been liberated."
 coptic_flavor.2.d:0 "The ancient city of Aksum rests safely in Mia hands. Once it was the heart of the ancient Aksumite Empire, a bastion of Christian power, situated at the crossroads of Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman world. Among the obelisks and palace [From.GetName] is rebuilding the churches of this mighty nation of old.\n\nThe greatest of them all is the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. It is the place where the Ethiopian Emperors have been crowned, the descendants of Menelik I, who was the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It is here he brought the Ark of the Covenant. Every year, thousands of pilgrims come to visit this holy place."
 coptic_flavor.6.d:0 "Yerevan has been liberated by our fellow Miaphysite nation [From.GetName]! In the early 4th century the sacred Etchmiadzin Cathedral was built there. For many years the cathedral has been the national and political center of the stateless Armenian people. Throughout centuries of war and loss they have found strength and the will to keep on fighting in her loving embrace. Now she will be restore her to her former glory!"
 coptic_flavor.10.d:0 "Glory to the Lord, Qasr Ibrim belongs to the Miaphysite [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName]! For many years this great Christian city has persevered, even though surrounded by religious enemies on all sides. Perched atop a cliff by the mighty Nile, Qasr Ibrim has remained a bastion of Christianity in Lower Nubia even as the rest of the region fell into darkness. Now [From.GetName] will utilize the city's great political and economic resources to spread the word of the one true God throughout Nubia."
 coptic_flavor.29.d:0 "As Miaphysites we celebrate Palm Sunday which is one of the Seven Major Lord's Feasts. On the seventh Sunday of the Great Lent we commemorate and relive Jesus’ triumphal entry into the holy city of Jerusalem. It is on this day that He drove away the merchants and moneychangers from the Temple. The crowd who cheeringly greeted the Messiah were waving palm branches over their heads and so do we as we make our way through the church on this happy day. During the procession we chant the joyful hymns and it is truly one of our favorite times during the Church year."
 coptic_flavor.40.d:0 "The Miaphysite religion has long had a presence in [cairo_province.GetName]. Some of the Patriarch's followers abroad have even claimed that we are keeping Copts captive in our lands... Perhaps they need a reminder of the situation?"
 coptic_flavor.34.d:0 "A party of Miaphysite diplomats from our neighbor [From.GetName] have crossed into our territory. They have an unusually large number of priests among them. Our advisors suspect that they are trying to make contact with other Christians to the north. The diplomats are worryingly tight-lipped on the subject of their purpose. Perhaps it is simply a religious matter, but what if they are attempting to gather allies against us? We would be beset on multiple fronts by fanatical infidels!"
 coptic_flavor.38.d:0 "After a long and arduous journey the diplomats whom we sent northwards have finally returned. They did indeed reach Christian lands in the end, yet they come back empty-handed. While many of the Christians they encountered listened, few seemed to truly care. In our isolation, we are doubly cursed – not only are we surrounded by enemies, the distance to the rest of the Christian community makes us outcasts. What happens in [Root.GetName] does not influence them and perhaps our ways are too foreign for them to relate to. It seems as if the Miaphysites are alone in the world."
 coptic_flavor.100.da:0 "[Root.GetName] has recently seen many a lost soul seeking guidance at the monastery in the area. In fact the region is becoming quite popular for people looking for repentance and absolution in the ways of Saint Anthony - the desert caves are well suited for the life of a hermit, allowing some of the most devoted Copts to spend years in contemplative solitude. \n\nMeanwhile, the population of [Root.GetName] take great pride in this piety. Some well-placed words of encouragement could allow us to bolster their self-esteem even further..."
