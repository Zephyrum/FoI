 women_history_events.3.t:1 "Kösem Kayzer"
 women_history_events.3.d:1 "While the heir to our land is still too young to serve as ruler, the heir's mother, Kösem Kayzer, has asked to officially serve as a regent ruler Rûm. She has already directed the affairs of this great state through her husband and one son. If she comes to power, she will rule in an era dubbed "The Kayzerlik of Women." She has never bowed to the whims of others, but the madness and ineptitude of her progeny are a great concern. One promise made by Kösem Kayzer is that she will use her wealth to support irrigation projects in the Mesopotamian desert. Shall we allow her to rule until her child is of age and hope to influence her actions?"
 women_history_events.3.a:1 "Make her Kayzerlik Ana, regent ruler of Rûm!"
 women_history_events.5.t:1 "Roxelana - Hurrem Kayzer"
 women_history_events.5.d:1 "It may surprise you to learn that for many years, Kayzers of Rûm did not take legal wives – an effort to suppress competition in the shabistan. But the great Shalimoon took Hurrem Kayzer - Roxelana - as his legal wife and raised her above all women in the empire. The Kayzer takes her advice on diplomatic and military issues and even lets her act as an official correspondent to Orthodox monarchs on our borders. She persuaded Shalimoon to limit Crimean slave raiding into her native Ruthenia and supported the construction of schools, churches, and hospitals."
 women_history_events.29.t:1 "Meryem Kayzer"
 women_history_events.29.d:1 "Wife and widow of Sorishu I, Meryem Kayzer is the first "Kayzerlik Ana" or Queen Mother of Rûm. Her marriage to the then-prince Sorishu secured for him a powerful and valuable ally in her father, Menli I Giray, which helped the prince in his struggle for the throne. The Mesir Festival is held every year to celebrate the healing concoction of herbs and spices administered to Meryem Kayzer when she became ill. She rules as her son's de facto co-regent, which signals a shifting status of the Kayzer's Mother and her increased share in power."
 women_history_events.93.t:1 "Mardina Kayzer"
 women_history_events.93.d:1 "The first and only concubine to Yigit III for a long time became slightly bitter when her husband took more concubines and sired twenty more sons and twenty-seven daughters. She soon forgot her bitterness, and Mardina Kayzer earned the gratitude of the Kayzer by procuring more concubines for him. Yigit valued her and consulted with her on political matters. Their only son Mehmed became Kayzer after Yigit's death, and Mardina became Kayzerlik Ana - Mother Kayzer, a title with much power. She steered [Root.GetAdjective] politics together with Arslan Kapi Agha, chief of the white eunuchs and head of the enderun - the imperial inner palace. During her son's military campaigns, Mardina was left in charge of the treasury and managed to persuade her son to follow her advice in many political matters. Mardina was described by a Venetian ambassador as "a woman of her word, trustworthy, and I call to say that in her alone have I found truth in Constantinople; therefore it will always benefit Your Serenity to promote her gratitude.""
 women_history_events.97.t:1 "Isikbanu Kayzer"
 women_history_events.97.d:1 "During the reign of Kayzer Sorishu II, Isikbanu Kayzer was his favorite consort and wife. Born in Venice and named Rachel Olivia de Nasi, she was abducted and taken to Prince Sorishu's royal shabistan, where she was renamed Afife Isikbanu Kayzer. Her beauty and intelligence, and the fact that she was the mother of the heir-apparent, made her husband ask her for advice as he respected her good judgment in various subjects. When her husband died, her son Yigit was away, serving as Governor. Isikbanu realized that his absence had created the perfect opportunity for someone else to seize the throne, with the Kayzer dead and his son away from the capital. Fortunately for her and her son, Sorishu II had died in the shabistan, and as security and privacy were strict, no one knew of his death. She kept it a secret, hid the body in an icebox, and sent words to her son to return to the capital. Murad arrived twelve days later, and with the death of Sorishu made public, their son became Kayzer, and Isikbanu became Queen Mother or Kayzerlik Ana. Isikbanu is now a formidable figure with great power and far-reaching influence. Her management of the government is very effective and her diplomatic skills impressive."
 women_history_events.97.a:1 "Besides being Kayzerlik Ana, she will be awarded with a position as an advisor."
