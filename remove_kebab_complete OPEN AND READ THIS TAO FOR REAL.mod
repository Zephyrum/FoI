==========================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS FILE


Tao, you need to add a "path" argument. Just set it to whatever the path to your local copy of the mod is in your "Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod" folder.

Also delete everything in between the equals sign bars or else shit gonna break.

Also also you MUST update the "version" line every time you update the mod on steam.
And copy the description and put it in a txt file or else you're gonna have to rewrite it.
